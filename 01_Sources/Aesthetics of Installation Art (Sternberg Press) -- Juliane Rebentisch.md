First, a warning: the following is not an attempt to distill typologies out of the various artistic experiments that fall into the category of installation art in order to arrive, finally, at a clearly circumscribed genre definition. Certain general traits of installation art can indeed be named, and they will be subject to discussion in the following text. But to create a typology beyond such general traits seems not only difficult, but also not very sensible, given the wide range of phenomena and practices designated by the term “installation" Why codify what is in fux? Neither will I attempt to reconstruct the genesis of installation art or offer a provisional survey of its current variety. If the title of this book has led the reader to expect art historical classifications that would lend structure to an as of yet relatively amorphous art form, this reader will be largely disappointed. For Aesthetics of Installation Art should be taken to refer to philosophical aesthetics.  

But given the fact that philosophical aesthetics concerns itself with the notion of art in general, what can it have to say about a particular art form? And, moreover, about one that is as varied and continuously evolving as installation art?What might be the promise of such an undertaking? We are familiar with the sad picture such philosophical business presents. Sometimes the chosen art form is declared, in daring theses, to be the paradigm of art-as-such; sometimes it is used simply to illustrate a general structure that might be equally well demonstrated by any number of other examples. But even with these two extremes set aside, aesthetics, by virtue of the very questions it poses, cannot renounce its tendency toward generalization.What, then, would the point of departure for an“aesthetics of installation art”be?  

We can approach the issue, as I will do in greater detail in the following, if we turn our attention away from philosophical aesthetics and toward debates in art criticism, or, more narrowly, in art theory. These debates have been waged since the sixties within the arts,and above all within the visual arts,over works which only laterat the earliest,I would say,since thelate seventiescame tobe called installations.1 Surprisingly enough, it is precisely here that the general questions of philosophical aesthetics resurface. To concede or deny that installations areworks of art alsomeans to advocate a particular conception of art.In normative debate, the very concept of art is at stake as well.This,of course,is not a peculiar feature of the debates revolving around the art ofinstallation.The entirehistory of modern art is one of struggles with the notion of art. On the other hand, however, the art of installation does not simply mark the most current threshold of this debate.What is interesting about installation art is not itsrelativenovelty,but thefact that it throws thefundamental problems of modern aesthetic discourse into sharp relief in their most contemporary form. I will return to this point later. For now, what is important to me is that,because of the internal connection between art criticism and the question of the concept of art, much can be gained from reading this criticism philosophically, that is, against the backdrop ofphilosophical aesthetics.  

Still, the fact that the general questions of philosophical aesthetics are not so general-as is demonstrated by the role they play in art critical discussions-is significant aiso with respect to philosophical aesthetics itself. For the questions of philosophical aesthetics do not, strictly speaking, or at least not in any interesting way, arise as general questions; they arise with a prospective or retrospective view of a concrete aesthetic practice. Philosophical aesthetics can paint a picture of its object—aesthetic practice—-only by (re)constructing it in an act of interpretation. Conceptual and aesthetic practice are therefore not simply opposites but imply one another; here, too, object and theory can obviously not be unambiguously separated, but are, as it were, sutured to one another. Just as art criticism, if it does not wish to be arbitrary, must necessarily treat general philosophical questions, philosophical aesthetics, if it does not wish to lose contact with its object, thereby becoming irrelevant, must always have art critical momentum. The respective foundational discourses of art criticism and of aesthetics, although not identical, depend on one another. If philosophical aesthetics is conscious of this condition, its task can neither consist in establishing norms alien to actual artistic practice, nor can it limit itself to classifying art as it finds it. Rather, the task of philosophical aesthetics consists then, among other thingsAdorno in particular clearly saw this as a fundamental problem of all critical philosophy--in the attempt to offer a plausible mediation of deduction and induction.2 Still, as debates within aesthetics over Adorno's aesthetic judgments and their dialectical legitimation clearly demonstrate (see also 2.2), how this theoretical task is to be accomplished after the end of idealistic systems remains a central problem.  

In recent years, however, an observer of philosophical aesthetics might have been able to form the impression that the discipline has generally distanced itself from Adorno's art critical ambitions and has now hardly anything to do with artistic practice or with the normative question of aesthetic judgment. Instead, the philosophically relevant debates in recent years, at least in Germany, have focused largely on what constitutes the practice of engaging aesthetic objects and, hence, the specific structure of aesthetic experience.3 The question of what constitutes aesthetic objects has been subordinated to that of the specific structure of our experience of them: aesthetic objects, in this view, are in general those objects that provide the occasion for a particular, specifically aesthetic experience. Accordingly, it is still considered protocol that academic specialists in aesthetics have some familiarity with art; this knowledge, however, would not seem to be a necessary component of their conceptual labor-—-in contradistinction to the traditional aesthetics of production or of the work of art. One might think that philosophical aesthetics has tended to retreat to the refuge from which Adorno's emphatically argumentative project (with and against Hegel) sought to release it in the name of artistic modernism——-to the domain, as subjectivist as it is alien to art, of an aesthetics of the judgment of taste.\* No wonder, one might then think, that the conversation between aesthetic theorists on the one hand and practitioners on the other has once again largely come to a halt. Nowhere is this gap between the two contexts of discussion clearer than with respect to the discourse on aesthetic autonomy. While philosophers continue to talk a great deal about aesthetic autonomy --notably the autonomy of aesthetic experience from the domains of theoretical and practical reason—in the world of more advanced art, the term has seemingly become a slur.  

But this opposition, I think, is deceptive. Both positions——-the academic defense of aesthetic autonomy and its disavowal in artistic practice—-encounter one another in a critique of the concept of the work of art. And in both cases, it is a particular concept of the work of art that is seen as discredited. This convergence is indicative. It permits us to view the philosophical aesthetics and artistic practices of the recent past in interrelation: an interrelation that would be lost if we saw on the one side a Kant revival--at best provincial but at worst indifferent to current artistic practice—and on the other side an abstract negation of aesthetic autonomy. The interrelation I am interested in is one between the anti-objectivist impulse of theories of aesthetic experience and the impulses toward the dissolution of the concept of the work in artistic practice. As early as 1973, Ridiger Bubner understood his call for a return to Kant in philosophical aesthetics—-aimed against the objectivism of the aesthetics of the work—also as a reaction to the destruction of the traditional unity of the work in contemporary art.5 Whereas Bubner, probably only ostensibly drew the conclusion that theory should dispense with the concept of the work of art entirely.° I would like to interpret the philosophical \*turn" to aesthetic experience introduced by Bubner not as a turn away from the concept of the work of art, but as, among other things. an altermative proposal for an anti-objectivist version of the concept of the work of art.7 Of course, this implies a significant divergence from Kant. Corresponding to and in critical engagement with some of the existing theories of aesthetic experience, the latter will here be understood not in a Kantian sense, as the pleasure the subject takes in itself (or in its faculties). but as a process that is essentially played out betwveen subject and object. Aesthetic experience, as I will explain in greater detail, exists only in relation to an aesthetic object; conversely this object becomes aesthetic only by virtue of the processes of aesthetic experience. The aesthetic object cannot be objectified outside aesthetic experience, nor does the subject ultimately become, on the occasion of an object that must be bracketed, the object of its own experience. The new conception of aesthetic experience as a process that comprehends the subject as well as the object of this experience to the same degree and equiprimordially. and which therefore cannot be attributed to either of these entities alone, follows a new conception of aesthetic autonomy as well. Art is not autonomous because it is constituted in this or that way, but because it allows for an experience distinct from the spheres of practical and theoretical reason, by virtue of the specific structure of the relation between its subject and its object.  

These general and, with respect to criteria that would be useful to art criticism, decidedly ascetic definitions nonetheless have an art critical point if we relate them to the normative debates about  

contemporary art. For, in art critical arguments concerning the concept of art, it becomes clear that the question of what constitutes an aesthetic object always already implies the question of what constitutes aesthetic experience. The two questions are two sides of the same coin. This can be demonstrated precisely with respect to those positions of the aesthetics of the work against which the concept of aesthetic experience is directed. Yet whereas the concept of the work of art remains prior for those positions, theories of aesthetic experience claim the primacy of this experience over its object (and its subject; see 3.2.3). If work-aesthetic positions can be criticized in light of a methodological primacy of aesthetic experience as objectivist, this is not because the work is conceived as entirely divorced from its relation to the experiencing subject in work-aesthetic positions. It is much more a question of how the relation between work and experience should be understood.  

It is certainly not by chance that the argument concerning the concept of art-—-which in this sense is always a double argument, one concerning both the work and the experience of it--has since the sixties revolved around installation art with particular vehemence. Installation art, in its diverse manifestations, clearly condenses qualities that have proven to be incompatible not only with the conventions of form in aesthetic modernism but also with the versions of aesthetic autonomy delineated by positions in production and work-aesthetic theory that were associated with these conventions. In art criticism, these incompatibilites resulted in a clear front line that remains in effect to this day: on the one hand, defenders of aesthetic modernism repudiated installation art as no longer autonomous art; while advocates of aesthetic postmodernism, on the other hand, repudiated the concept of aesthetic autonomy rather than the new art form. Both sides, as I hope to demonstrate, are simultaneously right and wrong. Both sides are right in that the various forms of installation art can indeed probably no longer be called autonomous in the sense of the definition of aesthetic autonomy associated with the standards of aesthetic modernism. Both sides are wrong in concluding that the acceptance of installation art as art inevitably entails that the idea of aesthetic autonomy must be renounced altogether. For without a concept of aesthetic autonomy,  

I would maintain, the term \*art" is conceptually empty. This may be one of the reasons why art critics have recently tended to justify contemporary art as theory or politics. Correspondingly, the discursive competence of many artists, a relatively new phenomenon that contrasts with the position of theoretical naivete traditionally ascribed to them, concerns primarily problems of political philosophy (catchwords: postcolonial, gender, and queer studies) rather thanthis blind spot is symptomatic --those of aesthetics. In order to counter this trend toward obscuring aesthetic questions in the discourse of art criticism and art practice (which is not to say that I wish to diminish the political dimensions of this discourse), I would like to make the case, in light of a new conception of aesthetic autonomy based on a theory of aesthetic experience, for seeing the tendencies toward boundary-crossing in art in conjunction with its autonomyexpressly with a view to the (time and again) contemporary boundarycrossings between art and life, art and politics, or art and theory (see3.2).  

Installation art is certainly only one example of this tendency toward boundary-crossing, but, I would maintain, an especially instructive one precisely because of its far-reaching genealogy and its unclear boundaries with other, traditional art forms. Regarding its genealogy, it is notable that a list of the potential precursors of installation art reads like a list of classical and neo-avant-garde movements. Particularly those that demonstrate that the history of modern art was already fundamentally shaped by tendencies toward boundary-crossing that some contemporary critics would ascribe in toto to so-called postmodernism.8 Yet if we indeed assumed a fundamental break between modernism and postmodernism, such continuity could not be explained. Instead, as I would like to show in the example of installation art, we should interpret tendencies toward artistic boundary-crossing not as a break from but, on the contrary, as a radicalization of the principles of aesthetic modernism. Hence, the impulse to transgress the boundaries of the modernist concept of the work of art would be postmodern only in the sense of an impulse toward a critical overcoming of modernism by and through itself. For what such transgression attacks is not the idea of autonomous art but an objectivist misunderstandingofit.  

Because installations, through their breach with modernist conventions of form, throw the central problems of modernist aesthetic discourse into sharp relief, they emphatically call for a different philosophical reflection on the concept of art--and that of its experience——a reflection, moreover, that is, as I will show, decidedly post-metaphysical. This is not to say that only installation art offers an experience of what art, correctly understood, really is. But neither is installation art merely an arbitrarily chosen object for such reflection. Rather, installation works seem to function in a particularly explicit way against an objectivism that is already inadequate with respect to interpreting traditional works. What we could call the anti-objectivist effects that installation works have on the concept of art might also be the deeper reason why critics continually extend the concept of installation (even retroactively) to the point where, at least with regards to certain aspects in each individuai case, it now seems applicable to nearly all art. The fact that installation art, despite--or rather, because of—-its ubiquity, offers a peculiar sort of resistance to a neat definition as a genre would then be an indication not only that what is conceived by the open term “installation'" is still in dynamic motion, but also that it would be pointless to discuss the theoretically relevant traits of installation art in the framework of a discussion of the characteristics of a new genre.  

In any case, installation art resists an objectivist concept of the work by transgressing the boundaries of the traditional arts into ever new fields of intermedia hybridity (see 2.3). As such, the diversity of installation art does not constitute a new genre. What is created under the umbrella term “installation" is not so much works but models of the possibility of works; not so much examples of a new genre but ever new genres. Installation art offers resistance to an objectivist concept of the work also by transgressing the boundaries that separate the traditional, the organic work of art from the space that surrounds it (see 1.2 and 3.1) and/or its institutional, economic, cultural, or social contexts (see 3.2). Yet, what lends the movement against objectivism in art theory and criticism particular momentum is the novel active role installation art seems to assign to the beholder. This aspect, however, should not be misunderstood to be a kind of interactivity: what the various movements of boundarycrossing refect is, I think, the constitutive role of the viewer for the ontology of the work of art in general. Installations are not only objects to be beheld but simultaneously also the site of reflection on the aesthetic practice of beholding. More than any other feature, what has often been called the "inclusion of the beholder” places installation art in direct relation to a central problem of modern philosophy: the problem of an ontology founded on the subject-object distinction.  

Now the question of how this ontology--and with it, the rationalistic control of the subject over the object--might be overcome by truly autonomous art is an important, if not the central topic of modern aesthetics: it is central to the works of such diverse authors as Theodor W. Adorno, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Martin Heidegger. This nexus of ethical-aesthetic arguments was particularly dense in the debates of the late sixties, which were sparked by the unusually radical tendencies in contemporary art toward boundary-crossing or the "dissolution” of the traditional concept of the work. These developments, or so it seemed, put the autonomy of art itself at stake. The very dissolution of the concept of the work, as critics of such dissolution asserted, paradoxically corresponded to a logic of reification that is the immediate antagonist of the autonomy of art. Seen in this light, installation works, especially because of their structural "inclusion” of the beholder, seemed to pose not only an aesthetic but also, and primarily, an ethical problem: they seemed to surrender to the subject's control (see especially 1.2). A defense of installation art (and the following is intended as one) must address this set of issues lest it leave itself helplessly exposed to the reproach that it is simply part of the problem diagnosed by this critique. But a rereading of certain contributions to the debates of the late sixties is valuable also because the categories introduced in these contributions remain extraordinarily influential even today, both in art criticism and, more generally, in academic cultural studies as well as among artists. The relevance these contributions indeed have for today's artists is indicated by the fact that the most interesting contemporary art is full of revisions and resumptions of artistic positions from the late sixties and early seventies.10 Yet, in the context of today's discussions, the categories of those debates lead a life of their own--one largely detached from any awareness of the problems originally associated with them. This is precisely why I believe we need to uncover the underlying argumentative contexts of the respective categories; not only in order to arrive at a correct understanding of the critical point of historical assessments, but also to develop a new, different concept of aesthetic autonomy that is adequate for contemporary aesthetic phenomena while matching the acuity of insight into these problems achieved in the sixties. It is important to recall this acuity, regardless of all the criticisms of the ways such an insight has been articulated not least in view of those “postmodern” positions that consider the concept of aesthetic autonomy as altogether dispensable (see 3.2). In this sense, too, the following intends to rehabilitate philosophical aesthetics as a critical project.  

I will structure my engagement of the aesthetic theories and theorems that characterize the discourse of installation and related practices in art criticism and theory since the sixties around specific focal points marked by the most important terms of this discourse. I do not claim, then, that what I offer is a catalog or index of all the issues relevant to the discourse revolving around installation art. Instead, I have chosen three terms that seem to focus the philosophical problems of relevance to our context: "theatricality” (part 1), “intermediality" (part 2), and “site specificity” (part 3). Their constellation, or rather the constellation of the sometimes interlocking arguments hidden beneath these terms, will, I hope, delineate the horizon within which critical aesthetic discourse engages its problemsimplicitly or explicitly -even today. Since the first two terms-- theatricality and intermediality—-have in recent years become keywords in extended branches of academic cultural studies, I should like to emphasize right away that my interpretation of them will move expressly within the framework of philosophical aesthetics.  

The following aesthetics of installation is thus indeed a treatise less on installation than on the terms engendered in response to it. Yet these very terms manifest the aforementioned close interrelation between aesthetic and conceptual practice. This is also the context for my decision to do without illustrations. Most "installation shots" for the term designates not only exhibition photos, but has come to be used also for the photographic documentation of installation worksare peculiarly sterile and unsatisfactory as reproductions of installation art, even of works that. as might be the case with a few tableau-like arrangements, seem to anticipate their own photographic documentation. or in other words. their translation into a picture.11 Installation shots cannot adequately reproduce installations because the difference that distinguishes the latter from the picture, the third dimension, is essential to our experience of them. In my opinion, the only means to collect the data relevant to an aesthetics of installation are those of theory and criticism themselves. Theory cannot quote installations like poems. The question of what it means, under these circumstances, to refer to an installation leads back to a problem I already mentioned, that of the mutual implication of concept and object. Due to the close interrelation of aesthetic and conceptual practice, it is necessary to pursue the argument on both levels, with constant reference from one to the other. The new conception of aesthetic autonomy I will advocate in the following is intended as an intervention in the conceptual practice of theory or criticism that aspires to do greater justice to the aesthetic practice under consideration. This requires an analysis of the various critical interpretations of installation art, but also an engagement of certain traits of the art form itself, a journey into the domain of concrete works. The fact that both my own interpretation of the aesthetic potential of installation art and my new conception of aesthetic autonomy are themselves contentious is not in and of itself a reason to reject them. On the contrary: I think that the argument on both levels as well as that about their relationship is the most interesting topic not only in philosophical aesthetics but also in aesthetic discourse in general. In this sense, and in view of the dangers posed by a retreat of philosophical aesthetics into an academicism on the one hand——-as estranged from art as it is irrelevant—-and by the regression of artistic practice into an abstention from all aesthetic conceptualization on the other, the following indeed intends to explicate and reopen aesthetic discourse as controversy.  

# Theatricality  

![images/06a62c01535452c6cd4539c7b64b1ef63173a100aaf650ac02b639e1412bc09a.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dVRxXSM.jpeg)  

T here is probably no other term used more often in art theory and criticism to describe installation art than \*theatricality." However, to speak of theatricality, also means to speak of a critique of it. For most writing about theatricality in installation art refers back to a single text, one in which this term is used in an exclusively negative sense: Michael Fried's essay, published in 1967 in the American art journal Artforum under the title "Art and Objecthood."1 on what he saw as the peculiarly theatrical quality of Minimal art and which remains notoriously influential to this day. The term "theatricality” indeed seems intuitively plausible in certain ways when used with reference to the spatial settings of Minimalist art, particularly in view of the significantly more active role this art assigned to the viewer: he would no longer stand passively before a work but was to physically involve himself with it. This innovation gave rise to the impression that the visual arts had succeeded in abolishing the separation between audience and stage, something theater itself was working on at the same time. But it was also in light of the strategies that had been developed since the late sixties in theatrical performance art in the more narrow sense that the term "theatricality” quickly became, as the art historian Rosalind E. Krauss put it as early as 1977, an “umbrella term? for a wide variety of artistic practices.2 Due to its application to performance art on the one hand and to installation strategies, which were rapidly expanding after 1970, on the other, the term seemed capable of characterizing those more recent phenomena in art that would soon be called "postmodern." In the 1980s, “theatricality"-— often used in a negative, but increasingly also in a positive sensethus became a token in the aesthetic debates as to how the provocations associated with the concept of postmodernism were to be interpreted. Nearly thirty years after the initial publication of \*Art and Objecthood,” Fried wrote in retrospect:  

"Art and Objecthood" was both right and wrong about the developments it described. On the one hand, it seems clear that [Minimalism] did represent a break with modernism as regards the terms of its appeal to the viewer. In fact, subsequent commentators who have taken issue with "Art and Objecthood" are in agreement with it on that score; where they disagree hotly is with respect to my evaluation of Minimalist theatricality. This is to say that the terms of my argument have gone untouched by my critics, an unusual state of affairs in light of the antagonism "Art and Objecthood" has provoked. On the other hand, my essay is nowhere near as pessimistic as future events would warrant from my point of view; I don't seem to have imagined the possibility that within a few years the art that I admired would be all but submerged under an avalanche of more or less openly theatrical productions and practices, as proved to be the case.3  

The fact that Fried's terms remained largely untouched by criticism, even when the value judgments they connote were reversed, is indeed astounding. Not only is the overall negative evaluation of virtually all art after 1970 problematic-even more so is the terminological system on which this evaluation is based. In the following I will propose, contra Fried and a majority of his critics, that theatricality is not a quality to be criticized or affirmed in a certain “postmodern” art but a structural feature of all art. Now, this hypothesisthat theatricality must be understood not as a quality of a certain kind of art, but as a structural feature of all art--may sound suspiciously like a ("typically philosophical') effacement of all art from the philosophy of art as well as, and more importantly, like a counterintuitive first step for the aesthetics of a certain art form. One consequence of this hypothesis is indeed that the concept of theatricality precisely does not designate a distinctive feature of installation art. Yet the art of installation has shed new light on the general problems of philosophical aesthetics concealed beneath the rubric of theatricality: with its emergence, the central terms of modern aesthetics have come under pressure, and the problem of aesthetic autonomy and the concepts of the work and of aesthetic experience must be rethought.  

In any case, I think that Fried's text. which at first glance seems to call very diverse things theatrical—-and this is probably not the least reason for its enormous suggestive powers--becomes comprehensible in its systematic and critical intention only when we consider it in the context of philosophical aesthetics. Fried's critique of the theatricality of Minimal art should, on the one hand, be seen in relation to a general ethical turn in aesthetics in the sixties, a trend of ethically motivated critiques of certain aesthetic phenomena whose protagonists, along with Fried, included Adorno, Cavell, and Gadamer. On the other hand, the topic of theater, or rather of theatricality, which only Cavell and Fried among these authors treated explicitly, plays a positively paradigmatic role in this context. In modern aesthetics from Hegel through Nietzsche to Rousseau and Diderot, theater is the one object where aesthetic and ethical aspects intersect. For it establishes not only a certain aesthetic structure but also a certain form of social interaction, and with it, consequently, certain models of subjectivity, both for the audience and for the actors. The problem of theatricality is therefore not a philosophically marginal phenomenon but a significant issue in aesthetics-—and Fried and Cavell are correct in turning their attention to this problem. But more importantly, the interrelation of ethics and aesthetics treated under this rubric gains new currency in the philosophical discourse of the sixties. This was due not least to the massive impact of contemporaneous theater practice, which was itself inspired by this interrelation.  

Theater has usually played two different and incompatible roles for modern aesthetics: that of its paradigm (Hegel and, more ambivalently, Nietzsche) on the one hand, and that of its antagonist (Rousseau and, more ambivalently, Diderot) on the other. Fried's art criticism clearly belongs to the latter tradition, the strand of modern aesthetics critical of theatricality. How much Fried is guided by this tradition becomes especially clear when one compares his writings with those of Stanley Cavell, who, like Fried, must be counted among its contemporary representatives. At approximately the same time that Fried articulated his critique of Minimal art (1967), Cavell wrote two texts on theater, one about Beckett's Endgame (1964) and one about Shakespeare's King Lear (1966/67). Before offering a detailed reading of Fried's “Art and Objecthood," I will begin with a brief analysis of Cavell's writings on theater: not only because I believe the two approaches can shed light on one another (Fried and Cavell are also connected in biographical terms, by an intellectual exchange that has left traces of mutual inspiration in their texts, particularly those on theatricality) but above all because a single figure of thought emerges precisely from the variety of objects under consideration; one that, surprisingly enough, has nothing to do with the meaning suggested by the intuitive use of the term “theatricality” in the context of the visual arts. Theatricality, in the context of the tradition that is critical of it, does not strictly stand-—-or stands only very conditionally—for a blurring of the boundaries between theater and the visual arts. This blurring, just like the question of intermediality in installation art in general, will therefore be treated elsewhere(part 2).  

# 1.1. 。1l 。Theater and Drama Stanley Cavel  

The debate over theatricality has always been played on a double register. Along with its undeniable aesthetic dimension, it has also always been about certain types of social interaction. The critique of theatricality is not only one of asymmetrical forms of interaction, it is also exemplary of the claim that forms of aesthetic interaction and those of social interaction are interrelated. Such a claim also unites the critiques of theatricality made by Stanley Cavell and Michael Fried -albeit from opposite directions. Fried articulates this interrelation from a perspective defined by the problem of aesthetic autonomy, Cavell. by that of intersubjective recognition. Yet just how plausible the claim of the interrelatedness of aesthetic and social interactions is something which remains questionable.  

I would like to begin with one element of Cavell's cultural critique. Towards the end of his interpretation of King Lear, Cavell criticizes the notion that the world has become so complex that we can no longer recognize our place in it, much less know how to act responsibly in the face of the omnipresence of suffering in it. This notion, according to Cavell, is not only tragic in its essence, but also "theatrical because it turns the world into a stage, others into dramatis personae, and us into mere spectators. In the end, so claims Cavell, it merely provides us with a cheap excuse for our failure to help. For, by withdrawing into the role of mere spectators under the cover of a false sense of helplessness, we become guilty. We become guilty, specifically, because we let others act for us—-because we, like voyeurs, observe their suffering without revealing our identity, and ultimately because we misconceive the specificity of our situation, our time, thereby failing to seize the possibility of active participation. What Cavell thus criticizes as theatrical is a certain attitude, one by which contemporaneity is turned into the passivity of voyeurism, and true recognition of the suffering of others is made impossible through concealment, disguise, and misrecognition. According to Cavell, we must combat this attitude both politically and aesthetically—-precisely because the world is not in fact simply present or evident to us; because we can never completely make it our own through knowledge; because we can never fully know the suffering of others but only acknowledge it; and because we can never fully control the consequences of our actions. These are indeed the conditions of our existence, but they are not excuses for what we do in it or fail to make of it. In this sense, every threat of the loss of our world (however tragic it may be)—- which always entails an instability of our own position, of our own subjectivityand every denaturalization of our routines is also an opportunity for change. On the level of morality, we can certainly subscribe to Cavell's general call for commitment, especially if we simultaneously understand it in political terms as a call for a hermeneutic realization of our own time. Without, at the very least, the attempt to understand the present in its complexity, commitment itself may amount to little more than a sense of concern.  

But what does all of this have to do with theater? What does Cavell mean when he writes that theater has to be fought from inside as well as from outside (see AL, 349)? Cavell is certainly thinking not merely of the possibility of a political or moral critique performed by individual plays or stagings-—of an attitude he calls \*"theatrical"- but of the structure of theater itself, with its division between the events on stage and the traditionally darkened auditorium, which, he believes, is paradigmatic of the problem of voyeuristic “"theatricalization."s Correspondingly, his call for theater itself to overcome theatricality amounts to a call for a different conception of the audience. To change this conception, to conceive the status of the audience in the theatrical situation in a different way, is certainly also one of the central projects of modern theater. The aesthetic projects of Artaud, Brecht, and Beckett can be understood as various ways of tackling the problem of the so-called fourth wall--the invisible wall separating the stage from the audience. In \*Ending the Waiting Game.\* Cavell describes how he thinks this happens in Beckett's Endgame. I would like to isolate a few points from his argument.  

Cavell remarks that, time and again, Endgame reminds the audience that the figures on the stage are acting and that they know this. After all, this is one of the recurring themes of the play. But Cavell is not really interested in such exhibitions of self-reflectivity. One could even go so far as to say that his reading excludes a refection on this dimension of representation, since he attempts to show how the audience's most empathic possible engagement of the dramatic events renders the fourth wall between the stage and the audience ineffectual. It does so. according to Cavell's reading of Beckett, firstly, by virtue of the fact that the audience never knows more than the characters do and that therefore, and secondly, the audience is a realtime witness, as it were, to what is happening to the characters. The fact that something is happening is what constitutes, for Cavell, the specific horror of Endgame (as opposed to Waiting for Godot, where it consists in the fact that nothing happens). For when something is happening, this means that the game has not yet come to its end. On the other hand, the uncanny statement by one of the play's two protagonists. Clov --"'Something is taking its course"6--suggests the horror of a loss of control. When something is happening to us, we no longer take action, and when we no longer take action, we no longer control ourselves. And then anything can happen, especially the thing that seems to scare the figures in Endgame the most: that their world-—that they themselves-—-might change. To the degree, however, that the figures on stage go through \*"something" in a sphere beyond possible action, they are, thirdly, no longer characters in the traditional sense but sufferers, clowns. According to Cavell, the ideal corresponding form of performative presentation would be a kind of hyper-authenticity, a form of acting defined no longer even by the hallmarks of the greatest possible authenticity in acting, but  

rather as a technique of simply letting things happen. For Cavell, this is especially true for the characters’ language, which occurs rather than is spoken. Correspondingly, it is words that do the clowning in Endgame——they slip out, break down, land back on their feet in a different place. That this clownish language event never really lets us know who might actually mean what-—-and when and how--is, in Cavell's reading, the actual drama of the play. Nonetheless, this drama is not grounded in any claim of a general lack of meaning, but, on the contrary, in the full acceptance of the fact that words never cease to mean something—that there is no escape from language, from meaning, especially from literal meaning. In Beckett, according to Cavell, there are no longer any roles from which the actors might distance themselves (as in Brecht), nor is there a message conveyed to the audience beyond the absurd events of language.  

These may indeed be interesting aspects of a reading of Endgame. But why——-this was, after all, the question—-are these features seen as marking a resistance to the problem of "theatricalization" in theater, when the distance between audience and dramatic events is here quite obviously not dissolved, when what happens to the characters is quite obviously not happening to us, and when even a spotlight turned on the audience would only further dramatize the distance? Understanding this is the key to Cavell's use of the concept of presentness, which he developed on the basis of similar considerations in his readingof $K i n g L e a r,$ and which I will take up again in the context of Fried's critique of Minimalism. How, then, does Cavell underStand theater's struggle against theatricality?  

The distance separating dramatic events from the audience is inescapable --this is the point of departure for Cavell's reflections on theater. It is a matter of an ontological divide between two worlds: the real and the fictional. In this sense, any intervention by the audience in the events on stage is always conceivable only as an intervention in theatrical representation, in the actors? acting, but never as an intervention in the drama itself. The drama’s characters and their fate remain in the inaccessible realm of an ontologically different space (see AL, 330). Cavell contends, however, that Beckett's Endgame or Shakespeare's King Lear lead to a point at which the audience no longer experiences this divide. which is constitutive of theater, as and in the distance of what--in loose association with Hans-Georg Gadamer's phrase, which articulates a similar critique --we might call "aesthetic consciousness.\* but rather as existential: as the divide between those who suffer and those who helplessly face the sufferings of others. The experience of such an existential separateness from others. Cavell writes, is simultaneously a profoundly ethical experience because it is only on the basis of this experience that a true recognition Of others. undistorted by an appropriation of their otherness, is posible. "It is only in this perception of them as separate from me that I make them present. That I make them other, and face them" (AL, 338).  

Whereas the attitude of "theatricalization" makes the other into an aesthetic object and, thus reified, incorporates him, what is at stake here is an ethical position that recognizes the other in his suffering as other. Paradoxically enough, it is therefore theater itself that leads to an experience that is diametrically opposed to the attitude of "theatricalization." In Beckett's or Shakespeare's theater, Cavell claims, the theatrical experience turns into something that purifies us from a "theatricalizing"—-that is to say, a voyeuristic -attitude that we may adopt outside of the theater. It becomes a cathartic experience, if you will. According to Cavell, the distance between spectators and characters indeed corresponds to the reifying distance separating us from the other when we are outside of the theater. In a certain experience of theater, however. the theatrical structure of the ontological separation between the auditorium and the events on stage shifts to fulfill a different function, becoming the condition not of aesthetic distancing but instead of an experience of existential separateness from the other. The only theater that makes such an experience possible, asserts Cavell, is dramatic theater. Assuming, that is, that we accept the conditions of the drama and seriously engage with its world and the fate of its characters.  

For Cavell, accepting the conditions of drama means, among other things, making the time presented by the dramatic action effectively one's own time.7 By seriously engaging with the drama, we are  

we are in the same time, the now of dramatic events (see AL, 334). Being conscious that the characters exist in a space inaccessible to the audience means, for Cavell, precisely that in the framework of such an empathic confrontation with the dramatic events we experience an existential separateness from them: we are here, in the haven of the darkened auditorium, and they, who bear the suffering, are there. Their space is the only one where action is possible. We, since we have accepted this, can do nothing but witness their suffering (see AL, 339). Furthermore, according to Cavell's reading, because the logic of the drama entails that we never know more than the characters do and are therefore also in no way superior to them--and because we, even if we were in the same space with them, could not end their suffering (because, for instance, we could not end but merely extend the play Of meaning in Endgame, since we do not know its actual implication)-—-the only difference between us and them therefore remains the simple fact that they are there and we are not, the fact that what happens to them is not happening to us: in short, that we are spectators (see EWG, 158-9). But—and this seems to be the decisive moral difference in Cavell's mind--in this process, in the process of our witnessing, we have become spectators who suffer from our passive position. The fact that we have accepted the world of the drama and engaged in its time—that we have recognized the dramatic characters in their suffering—-confers, for Cavell, a different status on our spectatorship. The position of the spectator is now something that we as spectators no longer aesthetically enjoy but existentially suffer. In the course of our empathic witnessing of the dramatic events, we should, according to Cavell, become conscious of this position of helplessness. This conscious affliction with the spectator's position should ultimately, then, and this is the final twist in Cavell's moral interpretation of the theatrical experience, aid us in leaving this position outside of the theater, where there are—-if we only try to envision the specifics of our situation-always possibilities to end the waiting game, that is, to act. For the consciousness of an existential separateness from the other, which, so explains Cavell, we experience in the theater in a particular way, is not only the precondition for a  

substantial and ambitious notion of recognition, undistorted by any appropriation of otherness--it also marks the only limit to our action that we truly cannot get beyond; it is the precondition, not the end point, of our ability to act.8  

At this point we may set aside the question as to whether or not we as spectators of Endgame or King Lear can actually ever know more than the characters, as well as what the chances are that Cavell's hopes for the effectiveness of such moral catharsis outside the theater could be fulfilled if the experience of these plays in the theater were actually as he describes it—as a reversal of our aesthetically distanced attitude toward the events on stage into an elevated consciousness of an existential separation from the other. One of Cavell's underlying presuppositions of such an experience, however, is a certain seriousness of engagement with the dramatic events. And for Cavell, this seriousness——-and this is the aspect I would like to emphasize here——means that our consciousness of the dramatic presentation (e.g., of the actor's achievements as actors) should take a back seat to the presence of what is represented (i.e., of the dramatic action and its characters). This suppression of our awareness of the process of representation in favor of an exclusive focus on the dramatic events also explains why Cavell, an Aristotelian at least in tendency, privileges the dramatic text.9 It is not by chance that his theses on the anti-theatrical effects of the dramas he treats largely do so without reference to actors or specific productions. Indeed, Cavell interprets references to the representational work of the actors as a shift in attitude that distracts from a serious engagement with the dramatic action and its protagonists.10  

In the theater itself, the anti-theatrical effect of drama must therefore remain tied to the viewer's active acceptance (of the world of the drama being staged) and recognition (of the characters in Lear, of the suffering clowns in Endgame). These accomplishments of acceptance and of recognition in the theater on the part of the viewer imply a subordination of any consciousness of theatrical representation to the presence of what is represented. If we as a theater audience engage “seriously” in this sense with the worlds of Endgame or King Lear and the characters that populate them, these dramas, Cavell claims, lead us—each in its own way——to that point of reversal, at which we experience the ontological division between ourselves and the characters no longer as and in the distance of aesthetic consciousness, which enjoys theatrical representation, but existentially in the abovementioned sense. Where this is not the case, theater furthers, if Cavell is to be believed, the tendency toward "theatricalization': \*Damnation lies not in a particular form of theater, but in theatricality as such. If, against that awareness, theater were to defeat theater, then while theater loses, it thereby wins; we have not found our way in his analysis of the scene in Lear in which Gloucester, who has become blind and is being led by Edgar, jumps from an imaginary cliff. In part based on this scene. which oscillates between signifying \*Gloucester's suicide” and the mere tumbling of an actor on an empty stage, Kott convincingly traces the significance of a modern, or more precisely, Beckettian grotesque of the absurdity of the human situation after the collapse of the old order in the tragedy of King Lear (see Jan Kott, “King Lear, or Endgame,” Shakespeare Our Contemporary [New York: Norton, 1964], 127-68, esp. 142 52). Cavell, in his "Ending the Waiting Game, includes a long, polemical footnote directed against this essay in particular: "It may be worth mentioning briefy some reactions to work which may appear similar, which is, in some ways, obviously similar, and yet opposed in spirit to what I have wished to suggcst." Kott, according to Caveil, violates the play by submitting it to an external theory of the tragic and the grotesque, and by wrongly insisting on a contemporary interpretation of Lear, which contradicts the notion of the classical as well as that of the contemporary. Because classical literature, being timeless, is always contemporary, any call to make it so would be tautological. Instead, the task is to repeatedly identify the—-inevitably contemporary -interpretation of the classic text at hand that does justice to it by showing that contemporary aspects of the interpretation, rather than remaining external to the text, draw, as it were, their significance and interest from the logic of the play itself (EWG, 159-60). Even though I think Kott delivers prccisely this kind of discriminating interpretation, Cavell is nonetheless right in detecting that Kott's interpretation is opposed to his own in “spirit": it is attentive to the dimension of theatrical representation, which Cavell systematically eliminates from his interpretation of the theatrical experience.  

outside, we have merely extended the walls" (EWG, 160). Indeed, Cavell's ideas of overcoming theatricality aim at nothing other than an overcoming of the consciousness of representation. Such consciousness is to be supplanted by an experience of empathic witnessing. Cavell calls this experience "presentness. What he means by this term is not so much the now of the dramatic action, but rather a continual attentive witnessing to this action on the part of the audience or, more precisely, an empathic attention to the characters’ suffering at each individual moment of the dramatic development, as incalculable as it is compelling. Obviously. aesthetic consciousness as awareness of theatrical representation does not count in this argument; moreover, it is from the outset identified with that voyeuristic position which Cavell brands with the epithet "theatrical in a negative sense. Yet the opposite of this attitude, the experience of the presentness of characters, probably requires the hyper-authenticity Cavell seeks in the ideal Beckett actor and in the theater audience. Like this ideal actor, who, according to Cavell's reading of Endgame, should not actually act, the ideal spectator, focused on and recognizing the characters? suffering, should not actually be conscious of the actor and his achievement as an actor. Ideally, the dimension of representation must play no role in this experience-drama must overcome theater.  

Yet even Cavell's initial identification of our awareness of the representational dimension of theater with a voyeuristic relation to the world and to the other cannot appear to be anything but strange. Although the moral critique of an attitude as noncommittal as it is voyeuristic may be plausible as such, this attitude would seem to have little structural similarity with the consciousness of representation within the theater. To see the problem of voyeurism as a structural problem of theater, and theater as the site where a reifying and hence false relation to the world and others is practiced, presupposes that we take no account of the difference between aesthetic and non-aesthetic contexts. Otherwise, the connection between a noncommittal voyeuristic attitude of the world and the aesthetic attitude of the theater audience is at best metaphoric.  

To begin with, however, we might gain a better understanding of the peculiarly skewed image of a structural correspondence between voyeuristic "theatricalization" and consciousness of representation in the theater by comparing Cavell's argument to certain theses in Hans-Georg Gadamer's Truth and Method. I have already borrowed the concept of aesthetic consciousness from Gadamer's book. Aesthetic consciousness in Gadamer, however, is not-—-as it may seem that I have suggested—conceived simply as consciousness of representation. Rather, Gadamer's term designates, among other things, the subject-metaphysical notion that the subject must be regarded as the center and “foundation” of aesthetic experience such that it has arbitrary control not only over its experience, but also over the objects of this experience. The critique of precisely this conception, that is, the subject-critical strand of Gadamer's critique of aesthetic consciousness, is notably revealing in our context. For Cavell's critique of "theatricalization,” that is to say, his critique of an amoral attitude that threatens to reify everything, even the suffering of others, into an aesthetic object, can likewise be read as a critique of the ignorance of a subject whose dominance over the world and the other is based on misrecognition." By \*"theatricalization” or aestheticization, as we might also call it, Cavell means primarily something very general: a relation of distance from the world or from the other, structured by asymmetry and misrecognition-a relation which, and this is indeed decisive for Cavell's argument, is precisely not specific to theater. Nevertheless, by confusing the problematic of "theatricalization” with an awareness of representation in the theater situation, he criticizes the latter just as Gadamer criticizes aesthetic consciousness: as a manifestation of the modern metaphysics of the subject. I will examine this aspect further and more systematically in the context of Michael  

Fried's critique (which is much clearer on this point) of the theatricality of Minimal art. What we should note at this point is that Cavell indeed criticizes the consciousness of theatrical representation in the theater as a trope for the subject-metaphysical blindness inherent in subjective domination over the world and the other. This may also be why he ultimately posits a subordination of the subject to the aesthetic object in contrast to the presumed primacy of the subject and its aesthetic attitude over the object. For this is probably how we should read Cavell's conception of the theatrical experience as an act of witnessing: as a conceptual subordination of the subject to the aesthetic object.  

It may appear as though the parallels between Gadamer and Cavell consist in nothing more than the fact that both Cavell's critique of "theatricalization" and Gadamer's critique of aesthetic consciousness aim at a critique of subjectivism. For Gadamer, one might think, initially arrives at consequences quite different from Cavell's. His critique of aesthetic consciousness would not immediately seem to give rise to the notion of an overwhelming aesthetic object. Rather, the encounter with art, according to Gadamer, must be understood as an "encounter with an unfinished event [that] is itself part of this event."12 Whereas this sketch of a conception of aesthetic experience suggests that subject and object, the two poles between which the aesthetic process takes place, are equiprimordial, Gadamer soon—and not incidentally in the context of his reflections on tragedy, among other things-—-offers an interpretation of the processual character of aesthetic experience that is decidedly critical of representation or, one might even say, Cavellian. Gadamer characterizes the relation of the spectator to the tragic events on stage as the “communion of being present,"13 as opposed to the "distance characteristic of an aesthetic consciousness enjoying the art with which something is represented.'14 And interestingly, he here defines "being present” more closely by what he calls \*"contemporaneity." It consists in nothing other than the spectator's performance of "holding on to the thing in such a way that it becomes ^contemporaneous,'which is to say, however, that all mediation is superseded in total presentness."1s As a consequence, the sublation of "all mediation [...] in total presentness," according to Gadamer, coincides with the description of the spectator as merely passively receptive. As in Cavell, the elements for an aesthetic of presentness amount to the conceptual predominance of the aesthetic object in Gadamer. With the notion that the subject might indeed actively “hold on to the thing” in order to witness (and accept or recognize) what ultimately happens without its involvement—with this turn to an aesthetic of overwhelmment—a conception of aesthetic experience is abandoned that had seemed to be implied in Gadamer's critique of aesthetic consciousness: a conception of aesthetic experience that is founded on the notion that the subject and the object of aesthetic experience are equiprimordial.16  

If, by contrast, we base our considerations on a relationship of equiprimordiality, we will speak neither of a primacy of the subject over the object, nor inversely of a superiority of the object over the subject, but of an event between subject and object. Such an event, as I will explicate in greater detail in the following chapters, takes place based on a specific aesthetic destabilization of the subject's hermeneutic access to the aesthetic object. It is in this sense that I would like to point out a specific aspect of the theatrical experience that, if not denied by an aesthetics of presentness, is at any rate marginalized by it. For it can hardly be denied that the perception of an irresolvable tension between what is representing and what is represented is one of the basic elements of the theatrical experience. This is true, I think, for aesthetic objects in general, but it is especially evident in theater: the actor on stage always simultaneously exhibits both himself as well as something else, the character. "You can't point to one without pointing to the other," Cavell writes, "and you can't point to both at the same time. Which just means that pointing here has become an incoherent activity” (AL, 328). Precisely this “incoherence,” which Cavell  

seeks to replace by a presentness of the character alone, does not, I would claim, foster aesthetic subjectivism. On the contrary, such an irritation calls into question the superiority of the subject over the aesthetic object. For in the \*aesthetic consciousness" of the irresolvable tension between actor and character—-or more generally, between what is representing and what is represented --the possibility of a knowing domination over the aesthetic object must be questionable. Such a destabilization of unproblematic hermeneutic access to the aesthetic object would then be a challenge, calling upon the subject to confront the object communicatively rather than enter into communion with it—it would be an occasion for interpretation rather than for reverential witnessing. For the latter presupposes that what is being witnessed (or recognized or accepted or received) is already clear. Yet because the aesthetic object—-which is in general not the individual character on stage but the theatrical presentation in its complexly structured totality—exists in the tension between the two poles, between what is representing and what is represented, the subject can maintain only an experimental, and that is to say, decidedly not controlling relationship with it. To resolve this tension in favor of one side, that of what is represented, as both Cavell and Gadamer seek to do, thus entails a failure to recognize not only the aesthetic dimension of the theater situation, but also the specifically aesthetic opening-up of an asymmetrical subject-object relationship that takes place in this situation between the aesthetic object and the subject.  

Because Cavell equates consciousness of representation in the theater with certain motifs of subject-metaphysics, and explicitly with the moral problem of a voyeuristic relation to the other, he effaces, it seems to me, precisely what, along with the ontological separation between events on stage and the audience (which is of constitutive importance to theater), essentially distinguishes theater as an aesthetic phenomenon: the doubling of all theatrical signs into what is representing and what is represented. Yet by seeking to resolve the tension between what is representing and what is represented in favor of what is represented, Cavell misses not only an essential structural element of the aesthetic, but also a decisive theme of modern theater.  

As interesting as Cavell's interpretation of Endgame becomes—-particularly if it is read as an indication that even the self-reflective focus on theatrical representation performed by the characters on stage means that the actors themselves enter into the drama by becoming its characters, its clowns-—such an interpretation would surely ignore the fact that the self-reflective focus on theatrical representation performed by the characters also means that the drama itself is nothing but theatrical representation. Beckett's Endgame oscillates between both poles-—-there is no escape from the drama. There is no escape from play. To fail to recognize this tension entails missing the point of Beckett's theater and indeed, more generally, of modern theater. For the latter is distinguished, across its most diverse manifestations, by the reflective treatment of the structural difference, already in effect in traditional theater, between drama and theater, between dramatic action and theatrical representation (Beckett, Brecht), if not even by an intention to radically emancipate the theatrical means of representation from the dominance of drama (Artaud, Gertrude Stein'7).  

Cavell's dissolution in the name of drama of the theatrical tension between what is representing and what is represented in favor of a presence of the latter exemplifies a motif of anti-theatrical critique that, as I will show in a further step, has been applied not only in the area of theater itself but also in the visual arts. On the surface, of course, entirely different issues are at stake in the visual arts. Whereas Cavell's critique of drama concerns morally relevant questions of the presentness or recognition of characters, the art critic Michael Fried develops his objection to the theatricality of Minimal art as well as his concept of presentness with a view to the problem of aesthetic autonomy. Despite these initially very different objects and questions. however, the two critics--as a close reading of Fried's "Art and Objecthood" will show-—-offer different articulations of one motif of anti-theatrical criticism.  

# 1.2. Theatricality and the Autonomy of Art (Michael Fried)  

What significance does the critique of theatricality have in the context of the visual arts? For Fried. in 1967, Minimalist, or, as he calls it, literalist art not only embodies a new.--theatrical-—-genre of visual art. Much more fundamentally. it represents a development in which "theater and theatricality are at war today, not sinply with modernist painting (or modernist painting and sculpture), but with art as such -- and to the extent that the different arts can be described as modernist, with modernist sensibility as such" (AO, 139). For evidence that this "war\* Fried sees erupting in visual art is being waged by the other arts as well, he points even to modern theater itself, and especially the attempts to create a different relationship with the audience. In this context, Fried mentions Brecht and Artaud, but not Beckett. It may seem surprising at first that none other than these two are to be the principal witnesses for his critique of Minimal art. For it would make perfect sense to see a parallel between what Fried calls the "inclusion'" of the beholder in Minimal art and Brecht's and Artaud's attempts to overcome the fourth wall and to redefine the status of the audience. One might even think that Minimalist art transformed the status of the viewer more successfully than theater did so of the spectator. After all, the viewer seemed to have been released from his passive role. He no longer simply came to stand in front of the work. but was. as it were, actively and physically included in it. And this accomplishment is indeed the basis for today's widespread positive assessment of Minimal art.18 Fried, however, sees this “inclusion of the beholder?d as the central problem of Minimalist art. At this point, the question of what exactly "inclusion" means in this context shall remain undecided—-particularly, whether it is actually a historically new phenomenon, the effect of a particular art directed at the viewer's activity, or whether "inclusion of the beholder” is not in fact a systematic trait of all experiences of art. The question is, first and foremost, how to explain Fried's positive references to Artaud and  

Brecht in view of his rejection of the Minimalist "inclusion of the beholder."  

We can begin to understand Fried's argument by taking into account the close exchange between Fried and Cavell in this matter. "For discussions of theater relevant'" to his essay, Fried lists, among others, Cavell's texts on Shakespeare and Beckett (AO, 147). Like Cavell, Fried sees the task of theater as the struggle against its own theatricality, that is, against its structural existence for an audience (see A0, 139-40). Fried adopts Cavell's idea that theater must seek to overcome the audience's reifying “aesthetic consciousness" in the medium of theater itself. Yet theater can only achieve this, according to Cavell, if it does not unleash its means of representation to produce effects that cater to the audience, but rather if it controls them in the service of the drama represented. Like “serious drama"—-and Cavell understands modern theater as the continuation of this by other means19 modern painting and sculpture, according to Fried, should first and foremost be defined by not being geared toward an audience, much less toward its “inclusion." Like Cavell's modern dramatic theater, Fried's modern art struggles against its own structure of existing to be looked at. And like Cavell, Fried theorizes the possibility of overcoming this structure in relation to the term of presentness. Accordingly, they offer parallel motivations for their aesthetic preferences. Fried's plea for a kind of self-absorption on the part of moderr art, for instance, calls to mind Cavell's ethically-based admiration for the Beckettian actor who is completely absorbed by the dramatic events, as we will see in a moment. Yet, whereas the experience of presentness in Cavell is tied to an act of empathy on the part of the audience--this empathy, as it were, is the mode in which and  

through which aesthetic distance can be cathartically reversed into a consciousness of existential separateness, and the ontological separation between events on the stage and the audience can be redefined——-presentness in Fried is primarily a characteristic of autonomous art itseif. How is this to be understood?  

The modern works of art that he admires, Fried writes, are distinguished by the fact that they are \*at every moment [...] wholly manifest" (AO, 145). Fried explains what he means by example of the sculptures of Anthony Caro. In contradistinction to the objects of Minimal art, which Fried rejects, Caro's sculptures, he writes, are immediately persuasive-—-and this means, at least in principle, at first glance, independent of the perspective in which they are seen. In this sense. they seem independent of the viewer's gaze: in Caro's "best work,' writes Fried, "one's view of the sculpture is, so to speak, eclipsed by the sculpture itself—-which it is plainly meaningless to speak of as only partly present" (A0, 145). According to Fried, Caro's "best? sculptures thus always convey an impression of completeness, regardless of the viewer's perspective. In this sense they are "continuously present." For Fried, it is precisely the impression of their independence from the viewer that attests to the autonomy—-for that is exactly what he means--of these sculptures. This "continuous and entire presentness" of the autonomous, selfcontained work of art, for Fried, is experienced as "a kind of instantaneousness: as though if only one were infinitely more acute, a single infinitely brief instant would be long enough to see everything, to experience the work in all its depth and fullness, to be forever convinced by it" (A0, 145-6).  

Like the call for the medium of art to transcend its structural condition of "existing in order to be looked at," the conception of an art which has succeeded in this sense, that is, of autonomous art, seems to a certain extent to be written in the spirit of the theorist of theatricality Denis Diderot, to whom Fried would later dedicate his book Absorption and Theatricality, which has since become a classic of art history.2° As in Diderot, one of the characteristics of good art for Fried is the instantaneous persuasion of a work of art, which means, the possibility of grasping the artwork "in all its depth and  

fullness" at a single glance. And, like Diderot, for Fried, good art —-by which he means autonomous art-—-is only where aesthetic unity exists.21 No persuasion without autonomy; no autonomy without aesthetic unity. And no aesthetic unity without compositional or, as Fried somewhat confusingly also calls it, “syntactic” organization of the individual elements of the work of art.22 It is not the identity of each element, writes Fried, that is significant in Caro's sculptures, but their “"mutual inflection" (AO, 137). And further: “The individual elements bestow significance on each other precisely by virtue of their juxtaposition: it is in this sense, a sense inextricably involved with the concept of meaning, that everything in Caro's art that is worth looking at is its syntax" (AO, 137-8). Caro's "syntax" is for Fried not only what binds the individual elements in aesthetic unity, thereby transcending them, but more importantly still, it is what, by virtue of such cohesion, lends his sculptures meaning--and indeed inexhaustible meaning. This is also the sense in which Fried's notion of the inexhaustible fullness of art (see AO, 143-4) must be understood: as an inexhaustibility of meaning. Caro's abstract sculptures, Fried writes, do not imitate any gestures of nature, but instead what such gestures perform. "Like certain music or poetry, they are possessed by the knowledge of the human body and how, in innumerable ways and moods, it makes meaning. It is as though Caro's sculptures essentialize meaningfulness as such—--as though the possibility of meaning what we say and do alone makes his sculpture possible" (AO, 138). What Caro's sculptures, according to Fried. allow us to instantaneously experience, what is convincing about them, is their embodied certainty of the possibility of meaning as such. One might also say that Caro's sculptures assure us of this possibility by symbolizing the meaninggenerating power of human gesture.  

In fact, Fried's description of the effect of Caro's sculpture is reminiscent of certain fundamental traits of the ideology of the romantic symbol of art that Walter Benjamin polemically criticizes in The Origin of German Tragic Drama.23 There is, first, the “mystical instant\* as the temporal mode of the experience with the symbol; second, the idea that the individual elements of a work of art, by the power of their cohesion, immediately transcend themselves to refer to something higher: third. so posited, the essential unity and indeed identity, conceived as coincidence here and now, of appearance and idea, of form and meaning: and fourth, the idea of the inexhaustibility of symbolic meaning. Last but not least, the almost theological motto of "Art and Objecthood," which connects autonomous art's "perpetual creation of itself'\* (AO, 146) to divine creation, also fits into this schema. It reads. in part, "because there is a continuity, which is time, “it is certain with me that the world exists anew every moment; that the existence of things every moment ceases and is every moment renewed.' The abiding assurance is that \*we every moment see the same proof of a God as we should have seen if we had seen Him create the world at first'"\* (AO, 116). And then, at the end of "Art and Objecthood," Fried writes his famous dictum: "Presentness is grace" (A0,147).  

Beyond its significance for a conception of a work of art in terms of an aesthetics of the symbol, this quasi-theological pathos functions in yet another way in Fried's argument. That presentness is grace.  

according to Fried, is especially true under the conditions of, as he suggestively puts it, a way of being almost universally “corrupted" or "perverted" by theater (AO, 147). That art should be the site of a quasi-mystical experience of grace under these conditions obviously assigns it a compensatory function. Herein, Fried no doubt differs from Cavell, whose moralistic conception of the experience of theateror, actually, of drama—assigns it the pedagogical function of enabling us to take action against a voyeuristic ideology of helplessness. Still, the similarities between the two on this point are conspicuous. Not only do both theorists conceive the aesthetic object as overwhelming and the viewing subject as passive--as a witness in Cavell's case, as receiver of grace in Fried's case-—-they also share a cultural critique that underlies their aesthetic conceptions.  

Like Cavell, Fried obviously sees in theater, or more precisely, in the aesthetically distanced position of the audience, a model for a false relation to the world, albeit one that is dominant in modernity. For both Fried and Cavell, the aesthetic distance of the theater audience from the dramatic events is exemplary of a specifically modern form of delusion—-namely, of a distanced stance that allows us to consume and reify in principle anything, even the suffering of others, as an (aesthetic) object. With this interpretation of the aesthetic stance, Fried and Cavell adopt a widely established reading, articulated most prominently by Martin Heidegger, of the modern discourse of the subject, which equates the modern subject with that of modern metaphysics and the latter, in turn, with the aesthetic subject.24 Similarly, Fried seems to assume (admittedly very implicitly) in accordance with Heidegger that, first, the “modern metaphysics of the subject" founded by Descartes—-that is, the epistemological conception of the subject as the foundation of (the certitude of) its representational relation to the object—-has immediate practical implications: at its core. this conception aims at the dominance of the subject. Fried also (and less implicitly) seems to follow Heidegger in the critical diagnosis that, second, nearly all areas of modern life are “corrupted" by the  

modern metaphysics of the subject and the theoretical and practical distortions it entails. And third, Fried, like Heidegger, believes quite explicitly that precisely this delusional formation is further strengthened by certain conceptions and forms of the aesthetic, and that these must therefore be fought both on the conceptual level and on the level of artistic practice. In this sense, what is at stake in the difference between the objects of Minimal art and Caro's sculptures is much more than a question of art for Fried: underlying the “war Fried evokes between "theatrical Minimal art on the one hand and his "antitheatrical' canon of modern art on the other is not only a dispute over aesthetic autonomy, but also one over the good life.  

But what in fact is Fried's reproach against Minimal art? First, Minimal art, according to the descriptions in "Art and Objecthood," is contrary to everything that Fried understands as the implications of the autonomy of art. The decisive reason, and the one that inspired the title of Fried's essay, is what he sees as the objecthood of Minimal art. At first glance, this approach may seem astonishing, for Minimalist objecthood--if we think, for instance, of Donald Judd's conception of the “specific object'"2s—-might very well be understood as the legitimate continuation of Clement Greenberg's formalist-modernist program, to which Fried remains committed. Yet Fried's critique of the objecthood of Minimal art entails a convincing critique of Greenberg's reductionist idea that the essence of painting must be sought in particular material qualities of its means of representation.° In particular, Judd's positivist idea of an inseparable and unambiguous whole that refers to nothing but itself embodies, for Fried, a heightened form of a problematic interpretation of the modernist project that is already in evidence in Greenberg.  

For whereas a central aim of this project, according to Fried, must be an art transcending its objecthood or materiality through a painterly or sculptural form, Minimal art emphasizes objecthood by virtue of the identity of object and form. Confronted with the Minimal object par excellence, the cube, the beholder can no longer seek out a fullness of meaning that transcends the individual material elements because there are no longer any individual elements. There is only a cube, which, in its peculiar literalness, is at once form and object. That is also why Fried speaks of Minimal art as a literalist art. One of Fried's lines of attack against the ideology of the unity and unambiguousness of Minimalist objects is to describe the effect of these objects, not despite but rather because of their literalness, as one of delimitation, lack of closure, withdrawal, latency, and dislocation. Indeed, his descriptions of the effect of Minimalist objects sound occasionally almost like motifs from a deconstructivist aesthetic, albeit clearly with a negative tinge. And surely one reason for the continuing resonance of Fried's short essay in discussions of contemporary art to this day is that his description of the Minimalist experience, despite his intentions, proved to be more compelling than the suggestion of a modernist experience of grace, inviting a redistribution of value between his descriptions27 as much as a postmodern defense of the very art that Fried had condemned.28 I think, however, that both possible moves-—-the transvaluing adoption of what are presumed to be deconstructive motifs in Fried's descriptions, as well as the postulate of a postmodern counter-paradigm against Fried's modernist canonfall short as critical reactions to Fried's text. The deconstructive transvaluation of Fried's negative descriptions does not sufficiently understand their critical content and so runs the danger of merely proving further evidence of what Fried criticizes; the postulate of an artistic counter-paradigm remains vulnerable for the same reason.  

What is really at stake in Fried's critique of Minimalism--and thus with the basic opposition between art and objecthood that structures the entire text--may be illustrated by the difference between syntax and literalism. which reflects the difference between art and objecthood in a particularly striking way. While the syntax of Caro's sculptures, according to Fried's symbolic conception, coincides, as it were, with their meaningfulness, Minimalist objects, despite or precisely because of the specificity of the industrial materials from which they are usually constructed, seem to him to be literal, blank, expressionless things: \*Like the shape of the object, the materials do not represent, signify. or allude to anything: they are what they are and nothing more. And what they are is not, strictly speaking, something that is grasped or intuited or recognized or even seen once and for all' (AO, 143). Whereas, for Fried, the syntax of a Caro sculpture endows it with a certain aesthetic unity that is constitutive of his notion of aesthetic autonomy—-understood as the impression of independence of the viewer—-Minimalist objects destroy this same impression due to their literalness. Precisely because there seems to be nothing to them in and of themselves, they—-like the commodity —-seem able to exist only "for something else" (Adorno). The fact that they would seem to exist, to be complete only for the viewer, epitomizes, in Fried's view, their problematic theatricality. As an antonym to the presentness of autonomous art that is, as it were, independent of the concrete perspective of the viewer, theatricality for Fried, means a regression of the work of art to the literal, a novel form of reification for which the exhibited and explicit dependence of Minimal objects on the viewer is particularly symptomatic. As he writes in an often-cited passage: "Whereas in previous art 'what is to be had from the work is located strictly within [it],′ the experience of literalist art is of an object in a situation—one that, virtually by definition, includes the beholder" (AO, 125). Contrary to a common way of reading this passage,2" Fried interprets this situation primarily not as an "inclusion of the beholder"  

but as one that puts the Minimalist object at the mercy of the viewing subject. As Fried emphasizes, “the situation itself belongs to the beholder—it is his situation" (AO, 127). At the same time, however, the viewing subject, to formulate it in a somewhat Heideggerian framework, is subjected to its dominating relationship to the object through the Minimalist situation only. Whereas Anthony Caro's sculptures sublate any distance between the viewer and the object via the impression of their presentness, the literalist objects of Minimal art, by being dependent on the concrete perspective of the viewer, not only emphasize the spatial distance between viewer and object. In so doing, according to Fried, they also establish a more fundamental distance—a relation in which any supposed proximity to the object can be only a symptom of an originary alienation, the result of a dominance over the object, not of an authentic encounter with it. “One might say," Fried thus writes with reference to the necessary spatial distance between the Minimalist object and the viewing subject, "precisely this distancing [...] makes the beholder a subject and the piece in question [...] an object (AO, 126).  

Such an experience, according to Fried, is no longer even dependent on objects, as he seeks to show in his analysis of the programmatic interest the Minimalist artist Tony Smith shows in dark highways, abandoned runways, and a drill ground in Nuremburg:  

What replaces the object-what does the same job of distancing or isolating the beholder, of making him a subject, that the object did in the closed room——is above all the endlessness, or objectlessness, of the approach or on-rush or perspective. It is the explicitness, that is to say, the sheer persistence, with which the experience presents itself as directed at him from outside (on the turnpike from outside the car) that simultaneously makes him a subject--- makes him subject--and establishes the experience itself as something like that of an object, or rather, of objecthood. (AO, 134-5) Here, once again, the critique of the “regression of artworks to the barbaric literalness of what is aesthetically the case” is clearly aligned with the critique of, to use Adorno's terminology, the mechanism of the cultural industry that “contrives to make that appear near and familiar to its audience that has been estranged from them and brought close again only by having been heteronomously manipulated."30 We can call this mechanism, with reference to Guy Debord, spectacle;31 Fried calls it theater. Even more clearly than in Stanley Cavell, the critique of theatricality must here also be understood as a critique of the modern subject-object relation. Fried's critique of Judd's category of "interest" should also be understood in this context (see AO, 142-4) as a critique of putting reified art objects at the mercy of the interest of the viewer, who in turn is called upon constantly to project onto that which is presented to him as a given.  

Countering this critique requires two steps. I would first like to discuss the aesthetic aspect of Fried's critique of Minimalism; and then. in a second step. I will investigate the legitimacy of fusing arguments from the philosophy of history with those of aesthetics, a move that is typical of the critique of theatricality in general.  

# 1.2. 1. Literalness and Meaning  

We have seen that the interpretation of Minimal art as an art that installs the modern subject-object relation in the space of art is dependant on a characterization of Minimal art as literalist or literal. Transvaluing the literal by means of a simple abstract negation of Fried's art symbol is, as indicated above, an insufficient defense. Like the Minimalist program of "what you see is what you see,"32 a simple positivist valuation of the literal would run the risk of confirming the critique of the artwork's regression to a mere thing by not seeing a problem where Fried recognizes one. More decisively from a systematic perspective, it would share Fried's assumption of an alternative between objecthood and art, mere thing and symbol. Where Fried's conception of art aims at the transcendence of the  

literal in the "depth and fullness" of symbolic meaning. the positivist position tautologically persists in the literalness of its objects. Both positions. howei er. separate what must be thought of in aesthetic union: the letter and its signification. material and meaning.3 Whereas the ideology of the art symbol purports to grasp the symbolic meaning as isolated--and independent. as it were, of the viewer's relation to the concrete appearance of the work of art—-the positivist conception postulates the ev identness of the visible. irrespective of any question Of the meaning embodied in the work. If we assume, however, that both dimensions  that of the "literal and that of meaning--are unavoidably interrelated. we arrive not only at a critique of the subordination Of the literal or the material to meaning. as expressed in the vestigially metaphysical ideology of the art symbol. but also at a critique of the positiv ist assumption of a facticity of the material that can he grasped irrespective of the meaning ascribed to it. as articulated in Stella and Judd. A critique of the latter. however, also implies a critique of Michael Fried's critique of Minimalism, which does not dissole the positiv ist self-misunderstanding of these Minimalists, but. hecause of the assumptions shared between them, even takes it as its point of departure.  

The fact that. in aesthetic terms. there can be no literalness, no objecthood. no thing in itself is perhaps nowhere more clearly indicated than in Fried 's ow n discussion of the \*"stage presence" of Minimalist objects. Here Fried's text can indeed be read against the grain, such that it does not merely decide the alternative between the position of an aesthetics of the symbol and that of positivism, between the cult of depth and that of surface. but in a different way, in fact undermines this altermativ e itself-—-and hence the altermative between "art and objecthood."4 For "stage presence" usually means a double figure: "The actor appears on the stage in a double role." Brecht says in his "A Short Organum for the Theatre. \*as Laughton and as Galileo."35 The chair on stage is both merely a chair and something else, a sign for King Lear's throne, for example. Fried's description of the stage presence of Minimalist objects demonstrates that even they are irrcducible to their supposedly pre-aesthetic facticity. On the contrary. in Fried's experience. they suddenly and surprisingly show glimpses of human features emerging through their objecthood: In fact, being distanced by such objects is not, I suggest, entirely unlike being distanced, or crowded. by the silent presence of another person;: the experience of coming upon literalist objects unexpectedly for example, in somewhat darkened rooms  can be strongly, if momentarily, disquieting in just this way" (AO, 128). Fried locates the grounds for this almost uncanny effect in the often human dimensions of Minimalist objects-—-or in the fact that the Minimalist ideals of \*the nonrelational. the unitary. and the wholistic [sic] apply to people more than any other part of our everyday experience -but above all in the fact that many of these objects evoke a secret inner life in an "almost blatantly anthropomorphic" way (AO, 129). Fried's aim, however, is less to expose the performative contradiction of an art showing anthropomorphic traits in spite of its expressed goal of avoiding any anthropomorphism in art, than to criticize the latency of Minimalist anthropomorphism.  

What is wrong with literalist work is not that it is anthropomorphic but that the meaning and, equally, the hiddenness of its anthropomorphism are incurably theatrical. (Not all literalist art hides or masks its anthropomorphism: the work of lesser figures like Steiner wears anthropomorphism on its sleeve.) The crucial distinction that I am proposing so far is between work that is fundamentally theatrical and work that is not. (AO, 130)  

Theatricality in Fried --if we think of his praise for the symbolization of gestural expression in Caro's work-—-is obviously not simply identical with anthropomorphism in art. He is concerned, rather, with a critique of a masked anthropomorphism.6 For Fried, the uncanniness of the  

Minimalist objects he discusses resides in the fact that, despite their highly simple forms, they take on quasi-subjective traits without wearing them “on their sleeve." They seem to disguise themselves like actors. Yet it is not entirely clear how this disguise actually works: is Fried referring to a concealment of an anthropomorphic core, of an anthropomorphic meaning under the mask of objecthood, or inversely of a masking of the simple object with anthropomorphic qualities that it does not really have? Whether the object shows itself to be a mere thing in order to obscure its true character, or as a quasi-subject that is in reality nothing but an object with certain qualities, what appears to be “incurably theatrical" is the tendency of these objects toward “self-transformation and self-reversal,"37 their indecisive oscillation between literalness and meaning. What is "incurably theatrical,” in other words, is their double presence as things and as signs. The doubling into thing and sign is indeed incurable, for the oscillation between thing and sign can never be fully sublated into meaning, as in the symbol, but it can also never be reverted into mere literalness. The simple objects of Minimal art remain "continually legible” (A0, 143) because they are unsublatably doubly legible, as thing and as sign, and as each with reference to the other. The material qualities of the object address the viewer as someone producing meaning while always subverting this production of meaning. At the very moment that the Minimalist object seems to have taken on anthropomorphic significance in the eyes of the viewer, it is equally clear that nothing about it objectively legitimates this: the production of meaning proves to be a projection of meaning. The viewer is referred back to the facticity of the material whose supposed evidentness now also proves to be unstable—-it is contaminated by latent meanings. In this way, the production and the subversion of meaning are interdependent in the double legibility of Minimalist objects such that they mutually reinforce and dispute one another.38 This, we might say, in accord with Fried, is what constitutes their peculiarly uncanny and “incurably theatrical” quality.  

Now, this "incurably theatrical' doubling into thing and sign is by no means a particular feature of Minimal art or theatrical signs-—-it is, I think, a structural aspect of all art. Contrary to Fried, this means that there is no such thing as non-theatrical art. For even in the case of a Caro sculpture, the experience of symbolic meaning, whose depth and fullness transcend the materiality or objecthood of the sculpture in such a way that it is instantaneously and conclusively convincing, is nothing but the expression of a fetishistic overestimation of the object by its vestigially metaphysical interpretation. Yet, because the simple objects of Minimal art seem to decidedly resist such an overestimation, they can manifest the double structure of aesthetic objects with particular clarity.  

Having noted the incurable and uncanny doubleness of the Minimalist object, its aesthetic character, as we can now put it in a more systematic fashion, we can already offer a first objection to the thesis concerning the subject-object relationship installed in art by the supposed literalness of Minimal art. Writing about the stage presence of the object, Fried himself in fact describes the relationship of the viewer to the Minimalist object not as one defined by the viewer's command over "his" object, but as a form of manifested uncertainty on the part of the viewing subject. Neither thing nor sign and yet both at the same time, the object does not seem clearly determinableit appears to elude any definitive establishment of meaning or literalness, instead confronting the viewer with a dynamic of mutually conflicting productions and subversions of meaning that cannot be brought to rest either by projecting a particular meaning or by determining formal facts. Even given the supposed evidentness of its form, an authoritative determination of exactly where some formal and/or content-related significance of the object is really located remains elusive. Because of its double legibility, the Minimalist ohject remains structurally uncanny. What is thus called into question is the possibility of a relation to the object that can somehow be understood as instantaneous, be it of the positivist variety or the symbolic one. Through the “incurably theatrical"-—-that is, aesthetic—doubling of the object, the subject's hermeneutic access to the object becomes reflectively thematic. “Theatricality, however, would then be the  

name not so much of the establishment of a hierarchical subject-object relation, but rather the title of an open space of possibilities—-which one might also call the space of the aesthetic experience-—-in which the subject maintains an experimental, or, at any rate, precisely noncommanding,relation to the object.  

The Minimalist situation, however, dramatizes this specific aesthetic questioning of the object relation in a particular way. Commenting on theses by the Minimal artist Robert Morris, Fried writes:  

Morris's claim that in the best new work the beholder is made aware that "he himself is establishing relationships as he apprehends the object from various positions and under varying conditions of light and spatial context" amounts to the claim that the beholder is made aware of the endlessness and inexhaustibility if not of the object itself at any rate of his experience of it. This awareness is further exacerbated by what might be called the inclusiveness of his situation, that is, by the fact, remarked earlier, that everything he observes counts as part of that situation and hence is felt to bear in some way that remains undefined on his experience of the object.(A0,144)  

Minimal art is here inexhaustible in a sense quite different from Fried's interpretation of the experience of art. Inexhaustibility is no longer attributed to the object; it is instead the experience of the object that is inexhaustible. While this description is clearly at odds with Fried's interpretation of aesthetic autonomy—-that is, the illusion of a work that is complete in itself and independent of the viewerit fits quite well with definitions of aesthetic autonomy in the Kantian tradition. Kant had already understood that the aesthetic cannot be localized in particular characteristics of the object but can only be explained by reference to the adjudicating character of aesthetic experience. But it does not immediately follow (although Kant suggested as much) that, conversely, the work of art or the aesthetic object is a negligible parameter of the aesthetic experience, especially under the conditions of a dissolution of the notion of the work. This seems to be Fried's fear when he recognizes a tendency in Minimal art toward doing away with the work of art entirely in favor of a celebration of pre-aesthetic “situations" (AO, 135). What can be seen from such a perspective is primarily only that the idea of the self-contained work. whether articulated in positivist terms or in that of an aesthetics Of the symbol, is based on an objectivist misunderstanding.  

This becomes particularly clear where Fried refers to the liminal case of Anthony Caro's "table sculptures," which integrate elements of their environment, namely tables. into the sculptural totality of their form. W'hile Minimal art stands for the unleashing of the object into the situation. Caro. in Fried's reading. represents the opposite movement Of an integration of elements from the environment into the object. Yet this very liminal case —-the integration of "properly speaking\* extra-aesthetic elements into the aesthetic totality —-illustrates Fried's objectiv ist assumption that aesthetic elements can be distinguished, apprehended. and identified from extra-aesthetic elements without difficulty.39 Which aspects of the work of art can be called aesthetically significant, however. is not only an open question to be answered by each new interpretation: that this problem can never, not even for a Caro sculpture. be definitively settled is, I think, constitutive of aesthetic experience in general. The border. the frame. the separation of outside from inside. a set of issues especially dramatized by the Minimalist situation --by. what Fried calls, its inclusivity -thus makes an aspect explicit that. as an element of uncertainty or loss of command in the hermeneutic approach to the aesthetic object, is structurally at work in all experiences of art. In the passage in "Notes on Sculpture” cited by Fried, Robert Morris writes:  

The better new work takes relationships out of the work and makes them a function of space. light, and the viewer's field of vision. The object is but one of the terms in the newer aesthetic. It is in some way more reflective because one's awareness of oneself existing in the same space as the work is stronger than in previous work, with its many internal relationships. One is more aware than before that he himseif is establishing relationships as he apprehends the object from various positions and under varying conditions of light and spatial context.40  

Because they eliminate internal relations or are sometimes presented serially in space, the simple forms of Minimal art seem to demand a heightened reflection on the viewer's performative involvement in the creation of relations-—-but in principle, this involvement is a feature of any aesthetic object relation. If "inclusion of the beholder,”" often cited as an innovation of Minimal art and installation art, designates this self-reflective and performative structure of the aesthetic object relation, then such inclusion is a characteristic of all experiences of art. The true innovation in Minimal and installation art would be the fact that the self-reflective and performative structure of the aesthetic object relation seems to emerge with particular clarity in the various spatial mise-en-scenes of the object. This effect is a consequence not least of the fact that the viewer here creates relationships to the aesthetic object by virtue of, among other factors, his physical activity—for example, by moving around the Minimalist object or the elements of the installation. But the self-reflective and performative activity of the viewer cannot be reduced to the physical-spatial involvement or to the interactive play usually associated with the term "inclusion of the beholder.” Accordingly, it is, in Fried's reading, less the necessity of moving through space to grasp the Minimalist object, than the “inclusivity” of the Minimalist situation that lends the aesthetic experience a structure that is not only practically41 incompatible with his idea of an instantaneously intelligible art  

equally manifest from any perspective, but also systematically at odds With it.  

If it is correct that the fundamental uncertainty of the object relation constitutes the distinguishing structural feature of the aesthetic experience, and hence also the basis of its autonomy from the spheres of practical and theoretical reason, then art is autonomous not in spite of but because of the inexhaustibility of the experience to which it infinitely gives rise. To the extent that the process of aesthetic experience in such a post-Kantian model of aesthetic autonomy is constitutive of the concept of the work of art itself, this also implies an internal temporalization of the work of art that cannot be anything but diametrically opposed to Fried's idea of its autonomy. The Minimalist object thus contradicts Fried's ideal of an art that is “at every moment [...] wholly manifest" (AO, 145), in particular because it proves, in the process of viewing it, to be unstable in a peculiar way: it is in itself constitutively processual. This processuality or internal temporalization of the Minimalist object "itself,”" however, is intelligible only if we understand it as mediated through the process of aesthetic experience.4 And this experience, due to the irresolvable double legibility of the aesthetic object, is fundamentally incapable of closure. This is why this specifically aesthetic experience of infinity, which at the same time always also exposes the finitude of the empirical viewer with his limited supply of time,\*3 is a particular target ofFried'scritique:  

The literalist preoccupation with time—-more precisely, with the duration of the experience—-is, I suggest, paradigmatically theatrical: as though theater confronts the beholder, and thereby isolates him, with the endlessness not just of objecthood but of time; or as though the sense which, at bottom, theater addresses is a sense of temporality, or time both passing and to come, simultaneously approaching and receding, as if apprehended in an infinite perspective.(A0,145)  

Fried is here clearly speaking neither of the time of a theatrical performance, scheduled with a beginning and end, nor, however, as has so often been claimed by those who pedagogically misconstrue the achievement of Minimal art to be the “inclusion of the viewer,” merely of the time that it takes to walk around a Minimalist cube or through an installation.44 Rather, the Minimalist sensibility for the “duration of experience"—and this is the object of Fried's rejection——is based on a consciousness not only of the fundamental infinity of aesthetic experience, but at the same time also of the fact that works of art cannot be objectified independently of the historically changing, and in each case finite, experience of the viewer.45  

Because works of art have no intrinsic objective being, the experience of them cannot consist in witnessing the “same proof of a God" with which Fried associates the ideal experience of art (see AO, 116). The fact that works of art are constituted in the process of aesthetic experience also means, conversely, that they cannot be understood divorced from their historicity.\*6 Contrary to Fried's quasi-mystical idea of a “presentness" of modern art that is virtually exempt from the historical continuum of past, present, and future, and can be experienced instantaneously and as “grace" (see A0 145-6), this means, first, that aesthetic experience's constitutive reference to the world ties it inextricably to the continuum of historical time. And to the extent that its participation in its historical present, which is always already mediated by a past and a future, is constitutive of the aesthetic experience, the past may enter into it as much as the  

projection of a future. That is its historical substance. "Smith continues to challenge time in his own way," the art critic Lucy Lippard writes at the end of a Tony Smith monograph from the early seventies, "his black presences evoke and revoke the past while awaiting the future. It is no accident that the ageless landmark in Kubrick's 2001, with its fantastic impersonality combined with an equally fantastic accretion of experience or association, seems to have been modeled On a sculpture by Tony Smith."47 What is reflected here is not only the historical situatedness of an aesthetic experience that is, by virtue of the realities contained in it, haunted by worlds past and futurethat is. historical substance—-but the historical changeability of this experience itself, which determines the future fate of individual works of art, their careers in other contexts of meaning, and their possible disappearance into meaninglessness. Smith's dark cubes, at least, seem to be prepared for their possible future roles in the historically changeable processes of aesthetic experience.  

In this sense, the artistic reflection performed by Minimal art due to the fact that there is no art outside the historically changeable experience of the viewers; that it cannot be objectified outside the performative perspective of those having aesthetic experiences; that it is inevitably in historical motion—-must be regarded as an act of aesthetic enlightenment. For to acknowledge these conditions by no means implies the problematic identification of art with arbitrary subjective experiences (Erlebnisse\*8) that Fried criticizes in Tony Smith (see AO, 132). On the contrary, such an identification can be rejected on the basis of the objections to Fried that we have offered so far. From an anti-objectivist perspective, however, we can reject this idea not by pointing to the necessity of traditional works or of the objective criteria manifest in these works, but by pointing out that aesthetic experience in general requires an object, and more specifically, a public object. Aesthetic objects are always objects of an intersubjective, public, aesthetic discourse; it is only in the context of such discourse that their aesthetic “objecthood" is manifested. (This "objecthood,” needless to say, is not the same as that of the positivists.) Precisely because works of art are constituted as processual in themselves and in interrelation with the process of aesthetic experience-—-because, as Adorno puts it, “their being is a process of becoming"-are "they [...] in turn dependent on forms in which their process crystallizes: interpretation, commentary, and critique '"49 Pointing out that aesthetic experience is dependent, internally, on aesthetic judgment and hence on a public object to which the aesthetic discourse can make normative reference, might contribute to a legitimate argument against a "Smithsonian” aesthetics of subjective experience—if Tony Smith were indeed advocating such an aesthetics.  

Smith's account of his experience, however, is far more complicated than Fried makes it seem. For Smith speaks primarily of particular landscapes that, not coincidentally, clearly recall ideas of the sublime: the giant empty drill ground in Nuremberg long deserted by the Nazis, the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike, neglected runways"abandoned works, Surrealist landscapes, something that had nothing to do with any function, created worlds without tradition" (AO, 131). Still, Smith does not claim, for example, that the industrial landscape that can be seen from the unfinished and unlit freeway is art. On the contrary:  

The road and much of the landscape was artificial, and yet it couldn't be called a work of art. It seemed that there had been a reality there that had not had any expression in art. The experience on the road was something mapped out but not socially recognized. I thought to myself, it ought to be clear that's the end of art. Most painting looks pretty pictorial after that. (AO, 131)  

What is at stake here is obviously not the end of art in the sense that random subjective experiences (Erlebnisse) are to take the place of art objects, as Fried reads Smith, but the discovery occasioned by certain artificial landscapes that art faces new challenges; that it must seek to no longer function pictorially, but situatively, in the manner of a landscape. We may well recognize in Smith's account-- even if we think of Smith's fascination for the industrial sublime-—-less the end of art than the prefiguration of new art forms. I am thinking, of course. above all of installation art and Land art, forms that have long been included among the recognized aesthetic objects of international art discourse. Yet only an anti-objectivist understanding of the work of art can do justice to these phenomena, phenomena that seem to reflect the critique of the objectivist understanding of the work of art by. in various ways, dramatizing-—in the wake of the \*Minimalist situation'—-the question of what is still a necessary component of an aesthetic object and what is not.50  

Fried, along with Heidegger, whose arguments, as I suggested above, seem to underlie Fried's in essential features, might at this point renew his objection that a theory and praxis that define art from the perspective of performatively generating subjects remain in the grip of the modern subject-object logic, a logic I have claimed would be aesthetically opened up by calling the object relation into question. For do not such a theory and praxis indeed "[posit] the artwork [...] as an \*object' for a \*subject'"?51 And does not the notion that the subject itself performatively creates its relationship to the object even more, that the subject constitutes the object in the first placeimply that art is subjected to a rationalist concept of the act and the subject? Given the possibility of such an objection, I would now like to show, in a second step, that the thesis of a structural correspondence between a performative object relation in aesthetic experience on the one hand, and a metaphysics of subjective command over the object on the other hand, is based on false premises.  

THEATRICALITY  

#  

According to Heidegger's critical interpretation, aesthetics, since its very inception, has, with respect to the sensory acts that it investigates, ultimately only repeated what rationalist philosophy had already asserted for the activities of reason: it posited the subject as the center and “ground" of the actualizations of each faculty. Instead of providing an alternative to the rationalist tradition within the territory of the senses, aesthetics, for Heidegger, proves to be merely another variety of the modern metaphysics that Decartes founded.  

Yet the subject of aesthetic experience should not-—-and Heidegger misleadingly imputes this Cartesian understanding to aesthetics in general52—-be understood as the metaphysical “ground’” of the aesthetic object relation. For one, that which a subject can grasp from an object--the subject's faculty of creating relations to an object or determining its features—-is dependent on a praxis that precedes the individual subject in the forms of a linguistically available world, linguistic systems of meaning, and specific ways of living. This praxis delimits what a subject can grasp as an object as much as it makes the object relation possible in the first place. Moreover, what the subject grasps, that is, what it can articulate as an object, is inevitably constrained by that object itself. Conversely, however, this triviality, valid for all sensual perception, must not be confused with the objectivist assumption that the object—above all the “particular,” the aesthetic object-—-might be capable, independent of the beholder, of "convincing,” without any interpretive act on the part of the subjectsuch that, for instance, the subject, faced with this overwhelming power of the aesthetic object, would have to resign itself to the passive role of a recipient of grace. This would be a misconception of aesthetic experience according to a Friedian model of presentness. Rather, the aesthetic situation is characterized by neither a precedence of the subject over the object nor, conversely, by an overwhelming power exercised by the object--it consists, rather, in an altered relationship between the subject and the object. This is perhaps nowhere more evident than in the, at least on the manifest level, utterly unspectacular objects of Minimal art.  

Contrary to Fried's objection that the distance between object and viewer provoked by the Minimalist object is what subjects the latter into his relation of command over the object, this distance must instead be understood as a prerequisite for the specifically aesthetic, reffectively uncertain object relation characteristic of the aesthetic stance. When Fried writes that the dimensions of a Minimalist work, together with its uniformity and non-relationality, distance the viewer-"not just physically but psychically" (A0, 126)-—this does not indicate the installation of the modern subject-object relation in the space of art. To the contrary, it implies that the distance, the becoming-unfamiliar of the object. which makes the aesthetic reflection on the objectrelation possible in the first place, should be understood less as the result of a subjective act --in the sense, for instance, of a change in attitude performed along voluntaristic lines-—than as characteristic of a situation marked as aesthetic by this very distance.  

One of the points of Georges Didi-Huberman's deconstructive reading of Fried is that the former has reinscribed within receptionaesthetic approaches the psychoanalytic slight against the subject that the processes of "'meaning-making" do not fall under the recipient subject's authority; that they can never be completely controlled: that the objects sometimes look back in an uncanny way.s Because what the beholder of Minimalist objects seeswhat shows or presents itself to him, approaches him  -simultaneously distances itself and becomes alien in this approach, perception opens up, according to Didi-Huberman, to a process that necessarily includes the work of meaning, which is also always unconscious. The ostensible closure of the Minimalist object relates to the openness of its presentation, that is to say, to the openness of how—-and this necessarily also always means, as what——-the object in question seems to present itself in  

each particular instance. Its form is neither simply evident, nor can the beholder bracket it by focusing on the “depth and fullness” of symbolic meaning. In the mode of an interrelation, in ever new constellations, of materiality, figuration, and meaning, it does not cease to "confront" the viewer (A0, 127). It is against this backdrop formed by the insight that aesthetic experience essentially consists in such "confrontation” that we should now also specify the as yet unclarified term “performativity” implied in the “performance of the beholder." The meanings that the viewer encounters in the work are neither objectively legible in the work nor, strictly speaking, “made” by the viewer. The viewer thus experiences himself in relation to the aesthetic object as a performative and productive agent without, however, exercising complete control over the subjective forces unleashed in this performance. The discourse of aesthetics reflects this experience in the notion of semblance. For semblance means, as Rudiger Bubner writes, “the becoming independent of the dependent"-—-the correlate of aesthetic experience's activity, or performance, with the aesthetic object.54 Performativity should therefore be understood less in the sense of an intentionally performed action than as an event between subject and object, an event that “befalls” the experiencing subject rather than being intentionally achieved by it.s5  

At stake in such an experience is not only the subject's approach to the aesthetic object, but also simultaneously the relation of the subject to itself. In his \*“Introduction to My Art Criticism," Fried-—-undoubtedly offering in part a late response to phenomenological objections to his critique of Minimal art--describes the Minimalist experience asfollows:  

My critique of the literalist address to the viewer's body was not that bodiliness as such had no place in art but rather that literalism theatricalized the body, put it endlessly on stage, made it uncanny or opaque to itself, hollowed it out, deadened its expressiveness, denied its finitude and in a sense its humanness, and so on. There is, I might have said, something vaguely monstrous about the body in literalism.56  

What is striking in this description of the Minimalist experiencewhich, I think, is rather theatrical itself—-are the underlying antitheatrical motifs Fried inherits from a tradition that runs from Rousseau to Cavell.7 For the notion that the process of "theatricalization" does not only lead to (the bodily experience of) a self-alienation on the part of the viewer but also deadens his expressiveness, even denying his sense of humanness, is in fact markedly reminiscent of the anti-theatrical contrast between theatrical pretense and genuine self-representation--the actor's self-doubling and integral identitya contrast that carries essentialist undertones. According to Rousseau, actors. precisely because they are capable of playing all human roles, necessarily give up the role of human being. Being human is something one cannot play but only genuinely be as oneself.s8 Yet theater, according to Rousseau, leads to self-alienation above all because it requires the ability to see oneself through the eyes of others—-be it as a necessity entailed by the actor's art, or as an auxiliary condition of theater as a social institution (while holding a glass of champagne in the theater lobby). But to see oneself with the eyes of others, to adopt a spectator's attitude toward oneself, is nothing other than a form of distantiation from the self, the prerequisite of self-reflection. To adopt a spectator's attitude toward oneself means to see oneself playing a role, and means also to conceive this role  

not as a natural fact but as a product of one's own subjective productive performance. Such a capacity for distantiation, in other words, implies a consciousness of performance.59 What does this effect of theater—an apparatus of modernization feared by Rousseau as alienating individuals from themselves and from the Republican community founded on "genuineness"——-mean in the context of our discussion? In contrast to Fried's Rousseauian interpretation of the "theatricalization" of the viewer as his alienation from himself, the "theatricalization" of the viewer can also be understood, I think, as a figure of aesthetic self-reflection.  

For Fried, "theatricalization' of the viewer means that he is encompassed by the “stage presence” of Minimalist objects, infected, virtually sent on stage himself—that is, made into an actor. Interestingly, Fried does not aim at a Rousseauian critique according to which the exhibition situation is not only about seeing, but potentially always also about being seen. On the contrary, the “theatricalization" of the viewer in the Minimalist situation according to Fried is associated with the fact that the viewer seems to be left alone with the Minimalist object in a peculiar way. “"That the beholder is confronted by literalist work within a situation that he experiences as his means that there is an important sense in which the work in question exists for him alone, even if he is not actually alone with the work at the time" (AO, 140). The viewer is left alone, as it were, with the Minimalist object on a stage on which he is obviously supposed to play the other role without, however, knowing how to interpret it, how to fulfill this role when he is persistently confronted by his silent counterpart. Given Fried's dramatization of the Minimalist scene, it may be an almost prosaic objection to note that the viewer is left alone with the object, in this sense, in any aesthetic situation—-even a distinctly cheerful one. Every aesthetic object relation is constitutively individual. To the extent that the viewer perceives himself in an uncertain relation to the aesthetic object, he will reflect on his part, his role in this relation, on what he, and he alone, is doing in this situation. Now this scene, regardless even of its spatio-corporal dimension in the Minimalist installation, is nothing other than the scene of aesthetic experience, which always also implies a form of aesthetic self-reflection. The aesthetic uncertainty of the constitutively singular subject's approach to the object leads, at the same time, to a reflection by the subject on his own production of relations, on his own activity of"[continual] reading” (AO, 143).  

This aesthetic self-reflection, however, should not be understood to mean that the subject, on the occasion of confronting an aesthetic object. ultimately becomes its own object; for instance by having the philosophically rich experience of the form of our understanding in itself.6 Rather—and here Fried's dramatization of the Minimalist experience may offer an important indication in another respectthe subject experiences itself as performative, as actively creating, in relation to the aesthetic object, without being able to objectify or even merely control the powers in effect within it for the purposes of philosophical cognition. This understanding of aesthetic self-reflection thus implies, once again, a notion of performativity that would inevitably mark any discourse of the subject's own production as bearing the index of otherness. On the other hand, what in the perspective articulated by Fried, whose vestigially metaphysical aesthetics of the symbol seems to imply a no less metaphysical notion of the subject,61 can be described only as loss of control and alienation (from the object, from the self) might well be described, in the Kantian tradition, as pleasure: the experience of the unfolding of subjective powers in relation to an aesthetic object. But, as I have already explained, since these powers do not have their "ground" in the subject and cannot be sublated in a subjective act of cognition, the site of aesthetic selfreflection can likewise not be the modern subject-object relation Fried and Cavell so stubbornly associate with the notion of theater.  

THEATRICALITY  

Given this stubbornness, however, we ultimately cannot but ask, why does "theatricality” offer itself as a metaphor for this subject-object ontology? The modern subject-object relation, that is, the asymmetrical relation between subject and object, is embodied, in Cavell, in the asymmetry of the gazes in the theatrical situation. In Fried, it is illustrated by the way the object is surrendered to the subject in the Minimalist situation. Whereas the asymmetry between subject and object is produced in the first case through distance, it seems to be realized in the second case in a figure of fusion. Both figures, however, are effects of the modern subject-object ontology, which, according to the diagnosis of its critics, establishes a fundamentally distanced subject-object relationship, both alienated and hierarchically structured, in nearly all areas of modern life. Whether this relationship is realized concretely as a figure of distance or as a figure of a false fusion is, then, irrelevant, if the focus is on an ontology the critics of theatricality wish to see fundamentally undone. This is the decisive task of autonomous art, not only for Cavell and Fried, but also for Adorno, Heidegger, and Gadamer. It must under no circumstances“surrender' to the subject.  

It is not by chance that metaphors of prostitution would suggest themselves in this context. In fact, such metaphors lie at the heart of the critique of theatricality. One need only think of Rousseau's famous invective against the actress who, as it were, doubly prostitutes herself: first, by showing herself in public for money at all (a shamelessness that is the privilege of the actress); and second, and this is something she shares with her male colleagues, by showing herself as something other than herself (the disingenuousness of the actor).°2 Above all, however, she is what she is for others. This term, being-for-others, serves in the critical conception of theater to merge a critique of the commodity with a critique of aesthetic representation (whence it is of systematic interest for our discussion, beyond the sexist-puritanical ideology hidden in the background of the anti-theatrical tradition). Correspondingly, on the side of reception, the critique of theater tends to identify aesthetic consciousness or aesthetic reflection with consumerism. Accordingly, the critique of theatricality, as we have seen in two of its contemporary protagonists, represents a double defense against these two complementary aspects.  

In summary: Fried's antagonism is directed against an art that is offered to the viewer not in the mode of aesthetic representation, but, on the contrary. by virtue of its literalness or mere objecthood; conversely. the viewer is compelled to project endlessly on what is presented to him as fact. According to Fried, Minimal art, like the commodity. is "for others." first of all. because of its literalness. But as initially shown, Fried's own descriptions demonstrate that his critique of the literalness of Minimal art is based on the uncritical adoption of a positivist (self-)misunderstanding on the part of certain Minimal artists. It quickly became apparent that, pace' Fried, even the simple objects of Minimal art are not entirely reducible to the pre-aesthetic facticity of their unambiguous form, as Fried had initially charged.63 It was. rather, precisely in the simple objects of Minimal art that a structural aspect of all art became apparent-—-the double and reciprocally referential presence of the aesthetic object as thing and as sign, its "stage presence."  

The rejection of the double structure of aesthetic representation, that is, of the aesthetic tension between what is representing and what is represented, in favor of an exclusive presentness of the represented, however, is the actual core of the critique of theatricality. It marks Fried's aesthetics of the symbol as well as Cavell's theory of drama overcoming theater. In Cavell, the projection of an overcoming of the aesthetic double structure aims at an overcoming of "aesthetic consciousness"-—-that is, the asymmetrical and consumerist relation between the viewer and the characters in the theater situation. In Fried, the projection of an overcoming of the aesthetic double structure aims at rendering art autonomous, ending its dependence on the viewer. Yet in both cases the confusion of consumerism and aesthetic consciousness or aesthetic reflection, like that of aesthetic representation and the commodity-form before it, is based on a misconception or, more precisely, a false description: the double legibility of aesthetic objects entails an uncertainty of the hermeneutic approach to the aesthetic object that must be understood—contrary to the anti-theatrical interpretation of this phenomenon as the establishment of an asymmetrical subject-object relation in the space of art--as the specifically aesthetic opening of this relation. For the object relation set into aesthetic motion, the self-reflective performative object relation, does not, as I have shown in a second step, have its “ground" in the subject. Instead, this notion presupposes the very concept of the subject and its acts that the critique of theatricality sought to criticize.  

Yet the problem of the misleading confusion of aesthetic representation and commodity, of aesthetic reflection and consumerism, also has consequences for the concept of aesthetic autonomy, which was set up as a double defense against both these poles: Fried's interpretation of aesthetic autonomy as the illusion that the work exists in itself, independent of the viewer and therefore timeless, proved to be an objectivist misunderstanding. There is, as we might object to Fried using his own vocabulary, no non-theatrical art. This is true both in view of the constitutively double legibility of aesthetic objects as well as in relation to the self-reflective and performative structure of the object relation in the aesthetic experience. Yet an interpretation of the work of art based on an aesthetics of presentness is not merely aesthetically misleading: it implicitly corroborates the very subjectobject relation it was supposed to overcome. The objectification, in an aesthetic of presentness, of the work of art into a presumably undisguised quasi-subjectivity is nothing other than a renewed reification of the aesthetic object into an entity for the receiving subject, whose presence to itself is falsely mirrored in the ostensible presence or presentness of the object. I will come back to the issue of the theory of the subject at a later point (in 3.2.3).  

But what does all of this have to do with installation art? For the features shared by critiques of theatricality that evolved with a view to quite different objects have demonstrated, first and foremost, that the keyword of “theatricality” covers and conceals very general problems of aesthetics. Yet my argument against Fried contained the first stages of an argument that is capable of defending installations as art (and not simply as valorized objecthood), and of doing so in a way that would not jettison the idea of aesthetic autonomy, as many critics who have objected to Fried's modernist conception of autonomy have ended up doing. Instead, my argument has led me to an important and systematic correction of the idea of autonomy that frees it from this objectivist misconception: a correction that transcends all decisions about possible differences between so-called modernist and so-called postmodernist art. Furthermore, the analysis of some motifs in the critique of theatricality has shed new light on the category of the inclusion of the viewer, which has mostly been understood, since Fried, as the particular achievement of installation art--for in this sense Minimal art can of course be regarded as installation art avant la lettre.64 It should have become clear that the aesthetic experience of spatial mise-en-scenes is not reducible to, or coincident with, the mere act of traversing them—this is in fact a widely held art-pedagogical misconception, not only of the experience of installation art in particular, but also of aesthetic experience in general. Against the backdrop of Fried's argument, it has become clear that the achievement of Minimal art and installation art instead consists in their reflection on the dependence of the aesthetic object—-and this dependence is generally constitutive of the latter—on the performative perspective of the person experiencing it. In this sense, Minimal art and installation art are not particularly “inclusive” art forms as compared to sculpture Or painting; rather, they reflectively highlight a fundamental feature of aesthetic experience in general, a feature the modernist conception of aesthetic autonomy denies or marginalizes. If, then, the art Fried calls "theatrical thematizes the "implicit viewer,"65 and  

thematizes him in a particular fashion, it does so not out of some extra artistic motivation but, on the contrary, in pursuit of the aesthetic status it lays claim to.  

If, however, in the course of a systematic examination of the arguments of the critics of theatricality, the terms “theatricality” as well as “stage presence” and "inclusion of the viewer” have become terms of an argument over what constitutes art and the experience of art in general, it also follows, of course, that these terms have nothing specific to say about what seems most conspicuous about many installations: their similarity to stage sets, their diffuse proximity to theater—in the conventional sense. What has emerged, in fact, is the fundamental inadequacy of the vocabulary used in the critique of theatricality for an assessment of art in general. Moreover, because, as I hope this chapter's engagement of Fried's argument has made clear, there is no art that is not theatrical in Fried's sense, the critique of theatricality, given its presupposition of the possibility of such art, is especially inadequate to contemporary art forms that implicitly or explicitly raise objections to this presupposition.° If, in fact, the proximity to theater is a significant aspect of some installations, the examination of this proximity may make a “re-entry” of the theatrical vocabulary into the discourses of art history and theory necessary. This discourse shouid then nonetheless no longer be marked by the guiding difference of "theatrical vs. anti-theatrical” in the sense in which it is used by the tradition of the critique of theatricality I have discussed. This, among other reasons, is why I will devote a section to the intermediality of installation art (part 2).  

Accordingly, I have thus far omitted one aspect of Fried's argument in my discussion: Fried cites only one other variety of the theatrical, namely, the particular indeterminacy of the medium of Minimal art. " What lies between the arts., thus an oft-cited dictum of Fried's, "is theater" (AO, 142). According to Fried, Minimal art, because it engages the problems of painting as well as those of sculpture, and hence stands, as it were, between painting and sculpture, eludes all normative judgment in a problematic way. It is no longer clear what it should be judged as. In contrast to the “convincing” works of art of modernity, which can \*support comparison with past work within that art whose quality is not in doubt" (A0, 142), Minimal objects elude such a comparison-—-and thus, according to Fried, lack the fundamental ambition of art: they are merely "interesting." It should be recognizable at this point that Fried's idea of a transhistorical quality of past works is another element of his objectivist misconception of autonomous art. We might therefore already suppose that the uncertainty Minimalism casts over the question of belonging to the traditional genres of art should be marked, from an anti-objectivist perspective, as precisely a critical quality, a contribution to Enlightenment. For this transgression of the boundaries of the traditional work of art, too, obviously stands in opposition to the vestigially metaphysical elements of an aesthetic of presentness.  

Yet as we will see in a moment, even the notion of intermediality is by no means unproblematic. In fact, it has played a role in aesthetic discourse since the sixties, which is at least as central and symptomatically difficult as that of theatricality. Because the context of these debates have had lasting effects on the assessment of intermedial phenomena, I will first turn to the most important positions in this context: those of Clement Greenberg, Rosalind E. Krauss, and once again to Michael Fried on one side of the Atlantic; and that of Adorno on the other side (2.1 and 2.2). In a second step I will then show that and how—in analogy with the anti-objectivist effects of Minimal and installation art we have discussed in this chapter-—-the hybridization of spatial and temporal arts in many intermedial installations can likewise be understood as a progressive-critical impulse relative to the positions I will now discuss (2.3).  

# Intermediality  

![images/8ab0670e753ad9f4781992eab817c49bac2b01ca621152d19ec51bdf5ea6d4f6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Bu4a30d.jpeg)  

What lies between the arts is not theatrical but intermedial. Intermediality, at any rate, is the term that has become established since the sixties for all those artistic practices that can no longer be categorized according to the traditional classification of art into the various arts. They seem to belong instead to new hybrid areas between the arts. In contrast with multimedia works. the arts here seem to merge into one another. Due to the continually rising number of intermedial productions, the term intermediality, like that of theatricality, has played a central role in the art critical and theoretical debates of the last forty years. But like theatricality, this term, too, bears quite negative connotations in the work of several of the most influential modernist art critics. Although these critics articulate their reasons differently, intermediality represents for them not only the hybridization of the arts but, moreover, a decline or even the end of autonomous art.  

The increasing trend toward intermediality, whose most important manifestation today is no doubt the omnipresence of installation works, obviously undermines not only the conventional classification of art into the various arts but, along with it, an idea of art that is tied to each particular tradition of the individual arts. Just how much this notion of art has defined the art critical debates over aesthetic modernism becomes clear not only when critics such as Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried parry transgressions of the boundaries between genres in the name of the tradition,' but also in the endeavors, such as Adorno's, to integrate the phenomenon of intermediality——to a certain degree-into the concept of aesthetic modernism. What unites these positions, which initially appear to be so variant, is the assumption that the technologically highly specialized engagement of the specificity of each individual aesthetic medium, historically informed by the formal tradition of the respective art, is indispensable for the production of autonomous art. This assumption is threatened not only by the increasing integration of various aesthetic media into individual works. It is threatened alsoand much more fundamentally  

by the Duchampian provocation whereby the concept of art is not at all tied to specific media and corresponding artistic skills. This provocation in art seems to have created what Adorno called a "nominalistic situation."2 One indication of the fact that art criticism continues to struggle in coping with a situation in which in principle anything can be called art (or so it would seem), is the stubbornness with which critics—most recently. Rosalind E. Krauss-——have time and again attempted to tie the notion of art to the problem of the artist's engagement with his aestheticmedium.3  

Continuing my argument thus far, I will argue first that the concept of autonomous art is in fact dependent neither on particular qualities of the specific aesthetic means of representation (Greenberg, 2.1) nor on the reflection on them (Krauss, 2.1), and therefore it is incapable of being deduced from either an affirmative (Fried, 2.1) or a critical (Adorno, 2.2) continuation of genre-specific traditions. Aesthetic autonomy is not something that can be guaranteed by production—no matter how media-refective the latter might be. It is, as I have already begun to illustrate in the previous part, explicable only with reference to the structure of the aesthetic experience, which must therefore also form the basis of art critical judgment. Media reflectivity, then, is one possible quality of art, not its sine qua non. It is, however, a quality-—-as I would like to demonstrate in a further step-—that has been fully developed only under the conditions of its critical relationship to traditional genre definitions. That is why the sixties saw an explosion of productions that broke free from traditional genre definitions and, in an unconstrained engagement with their various aesthetic media, brought out aspects of these media that had previously not come into view. With and contra to Adorno, I will show that it was precisely the emancipation of art from traditional genre boundaries that promoted reflection on the specific qualities of various aesthetic media (see 2.2).  

In the third place, I would like to show--via an examination of the hybrid art forms of (now in a strict sense) theatrical installation, cinematographic installation, and sound installation ---that the impulse to transgress the traditional genre boundaries is directed against an objectivist conception of art and its experience. This nexus, I believe, is especially manifest in the field of installation art. The previous chapter has already demonstrated that installations undermine the objectivist ideal of an art that is capable of being grasped instantaneously (see 3.1 for a more thorough discussion). Complementarily, 2.3 will show that the forms of installation art that treat or integrate time-based arts work specifically in opposition to the objectivist ideal of a synchronicity between the work and the act of viewing. Although the art of installation thus finds itself once again in opposition to central strands of the modernist art discourse, as I will show in a discussion of Cavell's reflections on the theater and Adorno's theses on music, I in no way intend to interpret the intermedial strategies of installation art as a break with the modernist project of aesthetic autonomy—they are, on the contrary, its critical continuation. But recognizing them as such indeed requires a perspective on aesthetic modernism that does not believe that the impulse in the latter toward self-critique has been exhausted by the conventions of "high modernism."  

# (Clement Greenberg, Niklas Luhmann)  

It is no surprise that the best-known advocate of programmatic "high modernism" was no friend of intermedial art. To Clement Greenberg's mind. such art constitutes the dregs, as it were, of a progressive democratization of culture that has been taking place since the mid-nineteenth century. threatening both the \*"levels of aesthetic quality" with the social rise of a semi-educated middle class and the loss of the authorities that establish and preserve values. Accordingly. in 1981, in the context of the debate over a postmodern aesthetic. he writes: \*"What's ominous is that the decline of taste now, for the first time, threatens to overtake art itself. I see ^intermedia’ and the permissiveness that goes with it as symptoms of this."5 While a reaction against the threat of declining aesthetic values is one essential motivation of modernist art, postmodern artists and critics now work to legitimize this very decline. And if we are to believe Greenberg, the consequences are disastrous: for while modernist art (since Manet) fought a serious and often uncomfortable battle to avoid sliding into mere entertainment and to retain its autonomy, this battle is being abandoned by the propagandists of postmodernism in favor of an \*“urge to relax."6 According to Greenberg's assessment, art in its postmodern stage, degenerates into entertainment. For Greenberg, the danger that art is made to serve the goals of entertainment is closely linked to its historical acquisition of functional autonomy. This danger appears precisely at the historical moment when art was released from the external purposes of religion or handcraft. He writes:  

Having been denied by the Enlightenment all tasks [the arts] could take seriously, they looked as though they were going to be assimilated to entertainment pure and simple, and entertainment itself looked as though it were going to be assimilated, like religion, to therapy. The arts could save themselves from this  

leveling down only by demonstrating that the kind of experience they provided was valuable in its own right and not to be obtained from any other kind of activity.  

Each art, it turned out, had to perform this demonstration on its own account. What had to be exhibited was not only that which was unique and irreducible in art in general, but also that which was unique and irreducible in each particular art. [...]  

It quickly emerged that the unique and proper area of competence of each art coincided with all that was unique in the nature of itsmedium.7  

What is immediately striking in this famous passage from his legendary essay "Modernist Painting” is that Greenberg underhandedly transforms the question of what is irreducible in aesthetic experience into that of a “unique and proper area of competence” in terms of aesthetic production. The answer is well known: Greenberg identifies this “unique and proper area” as certain qualities of the distinctive media, or more precisely, the representational means of the individual art forms. For instance, what constitutes the “unique and proper area of competence” of painting according to Greenberg is the Hlatness of the canvas--in contrast, for example, to the three-dimensionality of sculpture. Briefly leaving aside the question of whether the essence of painting can actually be found in the flatness of the canvas, we should note, that we can tell the history of art becoming autonomous as a history of the increasing awareness and focus in each individual art with its specific means of representation only if, like Greenberg, we tie the idea of aesthetic autonomy to the possibility of a somehow specifically aesthetic area of competence. And only then wili the phenomenon of intermediality, as it has increasingly emerged in the centers of the international art world since the late sixties, inevitably appear as the simultaneous expression not only of an art that is no longer autonomous but also of a break with the modernist project in favor of—-to use the vocabulary of contemporary art criticism—-an affirmation of the status quo in the culture of spectacle. Greenberg's argument in fact extends into current debates. Michael Fried’s critique of the  

theatricality of what lies between the arts follows this line; but so does, for instance, Rosalind E. Krauss's more recent attempt to rehabilitate the modernist idea of medium specificity against the rise of intermedial installation art, which she regards as tainted by spectacle.8 Both Fried and Krauss certainly criticize Greenbcrg's idea that each of the arts has an essence that can be localized in certain qualities of its means of representation and is therefore transhistorical. But all three -Greenberg, Fried, and Krauss- -conceive aesthetic autonomy as a proper area of competence determined by the medium of each art, an area that must be defended against the evil variously known as the "culture of spectacle” or the "flood of images" or the "aestheticization of the life-world."  

But what constitutes the area of aesthetic property, of medium specificity, if the essence of an art is no longer simply to be identifiedas in Greenberg--with certain material qualities of the corresponding means of representation? Krauss addresses this problem by starting from a principle of the aesthetic medium's “self-differing” from “a layering of conventions never simply collapsed into the physicality of their support." Yet to talk of a “self-differing of the aesthetic medium" seems to me somewhat misleading. If I understand things correctly, what she means by this phrase is better described by Niklas Luhmann's distinction between medium and form.10 Luhmann uses the term "medium" to refer to the “loose coupling of elements,” which "leaves room for multiple combinations" (ASS, 104). By contrast, forms, following Luhmann's definition, are “generated in a medium via a tight coupling of its elements" (ASS, 104). To the extent that Krauss's formula of the "self-differing of the aesthetic medium" is meant to integrate the artistic practice of shaping and reshaping conventions in interaction with the respective aesthetic medium into the concept of that medium itself, it is objectionable (via Luhmann) that painting (as opposed to canvas or paint), for example, is precisely not a medium but a way of creating form. Moreover, the distinction between medium and form might also serve to more precisely formulate Krauss's valid objection to Greenberg's media positivism. According to Luhmann, "the medium can only be observed as forms, never as such" (ASS, 106). All forms therefore appear as accidental in relation to the medium, and they do so for structural reasons. None ever express the essence of the medium; not even, and in fact precisely not, when the medium appears as form in the artwork as, for example, canvas and paint do in the case of Jackson Pollock's paintings, well known to have been prized by Greenberg. For the fact that the material from which a work of art is made “makes a difference" for the latter, as Luhmann would put it--that is, that this material itself becomes form—-is structurally true of all art. Yet Pollock's paintings, one might say, seem to reflect in a particular way on the transition of the medium into the contingency of form-creation. They thus seem to address the medium in its potentiality, or, as Luhmann would put it, as “leav[ing] room for multiple combinations,” rather than making its essence visible.  

It is indeed true that media limit what one can do with them. Nonetheless, as Luhmann says, “"their arsenal of possibilities is generally large enough to prevent fixation on a few forms. If this happened, then the medium/form distinction would collapse" (ASS, 105). Greenberg's stipulation, then, that modern painting expresses the “fatness" of its medium is problematic not oniy because of the underlying positivist assumption that there is an essence to each of the aesthetic media that can be observed independently of the historically contingent formal repertoires, an essence to which, according to Greenberg's teleological interpretation of the modern project, each art ultimately gave specific expression. It is problematic above all because it at least tends to collapse the distinction between medium and form, resulting in borderline absurd theoretical constraints on the possibilities of painting (possibilities that, needless to say, have been and continue to be available in praxis). On the other hand, and even more importantly, the tendency to identify medium and form cannot but lead to a conceptual failure to appreciate the formal, even the pictorial quality of Pollock's paintings as well as the theoretical provocation implicitin, for example, [[Ad Reinhardt]]'s black paintings, whose subject seems to be an approximate but incomplete convergence of medium and form.12 By contrast, both Krauss's notion of the self-differing of media and Fried's remark in response to Greenberg that the fatness and limitedness of the canvas are not the \*irreducible essence of pictorial  

For more on this, see Gottfried Boehm's definition of iconicity on the basis of the theorem of "iconic difference,”" that is, the \*“basic contrast [...] between a limited plane and all the internal events it includes." Gottfried Boehm, "Die Wiederkehr der Bilder,\* in Was ist ein Bild? (Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 1994). 30. This is arguably what Greenberg's own insight suggests--that the flatness modernist painting strives for can never be absolute but \*necessarily" engenders a minimum of "optical illusion." Greenberg, "Modernist Painting," 90. Even Greenberg's controversial remark that a canvas stretched across a frame is already a picture. even if "not necessarily a successful one," can be understood in this context. Greenberg, “After Abstract Expressionism, 131. Although Greenberg himself surely intended this remark in the sense of his reduction of painting to the expression of the fatness of the canvas, we could argue that the unpainted canvas is in fact potentially a picture, because, in this case, the structure of the canvas itself constitutes the internal events, whose comprehensive plane it simultaneously functions as. Even the borderline case of such an exhibition of \*hardware w ould not necessarily express the essence of the medium, but w ould, to use Luhmann's terminology, be another case of the tight coupling of its elements. Michael Fried, however, in a footnoted discussion of Greenberg's remark, attempts to exclude the unpainted canvas from the debate because he believes it belongs to the category of objects of the first order, of simple things (AO, 123). To recognize it as a painting would imply, for Fried, not only the end of painting, but simultaneously also the end of art. But, as we noted in the preceding chapter, the difference between art and objecthood is not dependent on that between complexly structured or “syntactic" form on the one hand and "literal" form on the other. In this sense, the bare canvas would be entirely conceivable as an aesthetic object whose interest would reside precisely in its being legible as a figure oscillating between readymade and picture. See the chapter "The Monochrome and the Blank Canvas," in Thierry de Duve, Kant after Duchamp (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), 199-279. Precisely because the empty canvas marks a borderline case in relation to the tradition of painting, it would be possible, for example, that e.xhibiting it would not only demonstrate the potential iconicity even of the unpainted canvas but also draw attention to previously underappreciated aspects of this tradition. For instance, refraining from emphasizing only one of its surfaces, an artist might bring the constitutive three-dimensionality of the traditional canvas to the fore. (On the constitutive intermediality even of the traditional arts, see 2.2.2.) By radically rejecting the production of interior events by means of paint, the empty canvas could furthermore render the direct and indirect contexts of painting--for example, the wall as well as the institution of the gallery—-visibie. For further discussion, see3.2.  

art"13 but merely its minimal conditions (AO, 123) can be understood as the restitution of the guiding art theoretical difference between medium andform.  

As I have already suggested, Krauss and Fried, in spite of their criticism of Greenberg, nonetheless accept Greenberg's idea that aesthetic autonomy cannot exist unless art defines its own area of competence, something that can be achieved only in relation to the means of representation underlying each individual art. Although Krauss and Fried criticize Greenberg's media positivism and open the question of a “unique and proper area of competence” of art to the historicity of artistic medium/form relations, both remain trueif in very different ways——to his basic theoretical intuition. Accordingly, like Greenberg, Michael Fried insists that a “proper area” of competence of art and, hence, aesthetic autonomy can exist only within the individual arts-—-and this means, only within the traditional boundaries between the genres. All interpretations of an aesthetic medium in the historical process of formal creation must ultimately serve to uphold these boundaries; they may expand or renew the concept of a given art, but they may not disrupt them by power of intermediality. Yet such a disruption, as I will later show, would not be the end of all reflection on the specific qualities of the respective means of aesthetic representation, but merely of the identification of these means with the methods of form-creation within the traditional generic boundaries. From the perspective of intermediality, the concepts of medium specificity and genre-specificity can no longer be identified. For Greenberg, however--and Fried follows him in this—-the self-critical reflection on the means of representation unequivOcally serves to demarcate and reaffirm the identity of each genre. This is, in fact, the decisive project of what Greenberg himself calls modernism.14 With the production of the sixties, at the very latest, however, it became clear that such reflection on and reassertion of generic property is closely and structurally interrelated to an en  

gagement of what is beyond its boundaries. (I will come back to this point in 2.2 and 2.3.) Yet Greenberg's influence is still felt where the dissolution of the boundaries between genres has already been accepted as a fact. Krauss, for instance, has rearticulated the idea that aesthetic autonomy can only exist if some medium-specific property can be identified. In light of a situation in which the traditional art genres have irrevocably lost some of their relevance, she shifts the problem to the level of individual works of art. According to Krauss, the possibility of aesthetic autonomy today is tied to the question of whether individual artists can succeed in “inventing” a specific aesthetic medium in relation to their individual artistic production and, hence. a \*unique and proper area of aesthetic competence."15  

Following Luhmann, however, we can pose a fundamental question regarding the premise shared by Greenberg, Fried, and Krauss. For all three share the assumption that the question of how to define aesthetic autonomy can only be answered with a view to the irreducible uniqueness of the various aesthetic means of representation. Luhmann asks whether unity in multiplicity--that is, whether a specific logic of art in general, a logic that would transcend the various arts or works of art—might not be found in the structural logic of the interrelation of medium and form. It would indeed be possible that this structural logic seeks to realize something analogous within the terrains of various media—for example, a specific, autonomous function of art (see ASS, 109). Interestingly, the pursuit of this question leads Luhmann not toward a theory of genre or one of medium specificity, but to the following art theoretical hypothesis, which overrides the medium specificity of the individual arts:  

Although perceptual media and artistic genres differ greatly with regard to their concrete materialization, they share a common ground in the manner in which they construct novel medium/form relations that are intended to be observed and are intelligible only when this is understood. The unity of art resides in that it creates for the sake of observation and observes for the sake of being observed, and the medium of art consists in the freedom to create medium/form relations. (ASS, 117)  

What does this mean?  

Unlike Fried, Luhmann does not assume that the form of art exists as a thing in itself: he proposes that works of art are constitutively "social media." It is, according to Luhmann, an essential element of the concept of the work of art that it is produced for an observer. Works of art, in other words, are media of a communicative exchange between subjects: as objects of production and reception. But and this, for Luhmann, is one of their particular characteristicsthey communicate through that which eludes all other social systems of communication: through perception. Whereas we can otherwise only communicate about perception, art communicates through perception. Yet perception in general (whether in the process of production or viewing) presupposes form as that which can be perceived. It is the object of perception. However, forms, according to Luhmann, always have two sides:  

No matter what [forms] indicate and fixate in the work of art, they always simultaneously present another side that must cooperate in rendering visible what is determined by the work. This is true if the artwork itself is meant to be recognized as a specific object (and nothing else). It holds for every detail that constitutes the work in collaboration with others.  

The unmarked space is the indispensable other side, a refer ence to possibilities that, for their part, point to an infinity that cannot be contained in one place. (ASS, 117)  

Every creation of aesthetic form begins with a step, a decision that separates the marked space, the space of the artistic form that is coming into being, from the unmarked open space of the possibilities of other forms: it begins with a brushstroke, a first installation marking in the white cube of the gallery, or something similar. This first marking, distinguishing marked from unmarked space, necessarily and simultaneously also engenders, and this is important here, the difference between medium and form. Usually others follow this first formal decision and these are thus no longer completely arbitrary. For each decision about subsequent markings henceforth entails criteria of accordance or aesthetic coherence. Such further possible markings as can occur in the marked space of the artistic form have to "ft, as Luhmann says (ASS, 117). Whichever precise emphasis we are to give to "fitting" in this context, it is fundamental that we recognize that in the work of art every marking refers not only to itself and to its interrelation (which potentially constitutes meaning) with other markings, but at the same time also always contains within itself a reference to the other side of the form-—-as Luhmann puts it, every marking, as it were, "instructs the observer to search for and fix what has not yet been decided" (ASS, 118). And this, Luhmann claims, is the case, \*for the artist as well as for the observer of art, and ultimately for any observation that depends on time" (ASS, 118). According to Luhmann, the aesthetic form is distinguished from other forms by the fact that we reflect on it against the backdrop of an unmarked space that makes it possible while at the same time undermining it.  

To the extent, then, that the medium of art can be understood as "the sum total of possible ways of crossing form boundaries (distinctions) from within toward the outside and of discovering fitting indications on the other side that stimulate further crossings by virtue of their own boundaries,” the medium of art remains “present in every artwork, yet it is invisible, since it operates only on the other side--the one not indicated—as a kind of attractor for further observations" (ASS, 118). The aesthetic form keeps its medium presentor, more precisely, the marked space of an artistic formal creation maintains the unmarked space of its medium, its possibilities—-as its other side. This constitutes, for Luhmann, the specificity of the aesthetic medium/form relation. Accordingly, the aesthetic form must also not be misconceived as the product of a process of artistic production that, once completed, is “there,” waiting to be identified without further ado by the viewer. Aesthetic form——art exists, so claims Luhmann, solely in the process of its observation, and this means in a collaborative effect of form and medium. In the process of being observed, the artistic form remains constitutively related to what it is not. And that is the case, according to Luhmann, on the side of its production as well as that of its reception. But what consequences does this analogy in Luhmann's model between production and reception have for the latter? What does it imply for the structure of the aesthetic experience?  

For Luhmann, one thing that emerges in the collaborative effect of form and medium is what he believes “characterizes successful artworks, namely, improbable eviden[tness (ASS, 119). \*Improbable evidentness" is Luhmann's way of describing the impression of aesthetic coherence that successful works of art wrest from the almost endless possibilities of their medium. By “demonstrating the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible, this achievement, according to Luhmann, is also one of the decisive social functions of art (ASS, 148). In this context, Luhmann (whose ideas here interestingly parallel those of Adorno, which I will discuss in the next chapter) also seems to conceive of aesthetic understanding as essentially a sort of reconstruction of the processes that constitute a work and its internal order.16 Still, it seems that we merely need to look to current artistic phenomena to recognize the limits of such an analogy between production and reception. For many works of contemporary art, fragmented and open in themselves, seem determined to elude such a totalizing reception. Of course, here, as elsewhere, Luhmann can be read on such general terms that his notion of “demonstrating the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible” applies even to the incoherent, schismatic, and abject in art. Nonetheless, the fundamental question remains whether it is correct to describe the structure of the experience of art as a reconstruction of the process of its production--the more so since it is already dubitable whether being confronted with a decision that engenders evidentness whil reflecting its own contingency, or \*improbable evidentness," is really an experience confined to the encounter with art. The reflection on the question of why something turned out one way rather than a completely different way is obviously not inherently a matter of aesthetics. The admiring reconstruction of an artist's decisions in view of the endless possibilities of his medium may indeed become part of the aesthetic experience, but I would claim that it is not a necessary condition of that experience.  

That is why I think that aesthetic experience should not simply be conceived in analogy with artistic production, as its reconstruction, but instead be discussed on its own terms. In fact, Luhmann's reference to a dynamic of medium and form may once again be fruitful for such a discussion. For Luhmann himself suggests, as I see it, how this dynamic might be rearticulated for the side of aesthetic experience in a way that helps account for the particular logic of this experience. In this sense, I would like to understand the "'staying-put-with-the-work in a sequence of observations that attempt to decipher it" (ASS, 126) as a process of understanding that, at every moment of its own process of formal creation, that is, of its own production of interrelations in or of the work of art, remains dependent on, and finds itself referred back to, the medium, the unmarked space of endless possibilities. Accordingly, the specific aesthetic dynamic of form and medium unfolds in the mode of a process of observation such that the latter does not end with the recognition of one possibility of order (as though this order were objectively (pre) determined within the work of art) to be observed, received, and reconstructed; instead, any possible formation of interrelations always remains dependent on the medium of such a formation-—-dependent, that is, on the medium by virtue of which and within which the formation of interrelations becomes possible in the first place. This, however, means something different for the experience of art than for the production of art.  

As 1 nave snown in tne previous cnapter, it is vy lo imeais cieal tu the receiving subject what can actually be called significant in the work of art. Any identification of significant elements of the work of art, as well as their meaningful interconnection, cannot in the end be objectively justified by anything about or in the work of art. The production of meaning-——-or even more generally, of coherence——-is sooner or later inevitably revealed to be a contingent projection. The viewer is referred back to the materiality of the work of art, which, however-as we have seen with Michael Fried in the example of the simple forms of Minimal art-—-is also not simply given as such. Instead, this materiality for its part now presents itself as heavily laden with meaning and provokes new formations of interrelations. The production and the subversion of meaning are thus inevitably intertwined and interdependent, conflicting with each other as much as building on one another. Art, as Luhmann himself writes, is neither "a sign for something else” nor "the mere form of the material" (ASS, 120). Rather, art exists, we could further say, following Luhmann, only in and as the dynamic of form and medium in the aesthetic experience. But the term “medium” here, and this is the decisive reconception, no longer denotes the endless possibilities of the means of representation in question. Medium is now the potentially infinite and open horizon of possible formations of interrelation given with each individual work of art itself. If, on the basis of this reconception, we apply Luhmann's suggestion that we understand the aesthetic relation between medium and form as implying that the medium remains present in a certain way in the form to aesthetic experience, then any interpretive formation of interrelations will inevitably remain dependent on, and find itself referred back to, its own contingency. And this compels the subject of aesthetic experience to refect on its own activity in forming interrelations. In the previous part, we have already absolved from suspicion the structure of an object relation that is in this sense self-reflectively performative, as articulated by the critique of theatricality, of consumerism, distinguishing it as specifically aesthetic; we also saw that the subject of aesthetic experience is by no means in complete control of this object relation. In fact, the aesthetic objects “themselves” seem to confront viewers with ever new. often surprising aspects-—-aspects, however, that cannot ultimately be pinned down in the object.  

What is specifically aesthetic, then. is not the experience of the "'improbable evidentness" of an object (or its markings)-such experience is indeed not limited to the field of art. What is specifically aesthetic is instead an experience in which the formation of coherent interrelations in relation to an object (and its markings), once achieved, appears in turn as both evident and contingent (with this conflict remaining uinresolved). We do not come back to an element in a work of art in order to represent to ourselves, in general terms, that another element could have been in its place (resulting in a different work of art) but because. given the way in which the work of art in each instance seems to present itself to us, we can (\*"evidently") also interrelate its elements, that is, interpret it in a different way than we have ("contingently") done heretofore. Only in this last sense does Luhmann's suggestion that we conceive the work of art as the process of a double transformation of its elements-—-in which it both accumulates meaning while becoming more markedly contingent-—-take on a specifically aesthetic meaning (ASS, 29--30).  

It may seem at first glance as though I repudiated with this reconception a feature of the aesthetic experience--or, rather, of the way the work of art appears in it-—-that is nonetheless obviously central to it: the experience of something like aesthetic evidentness. But I think that Luhmann's notion of "improbable evidentness, rather than helping to conceptualize the phenomenon of aesthetic evidentness, obscures it. In my view, the experience of aesthetic evidentness refers not to the way in which the work of art is objectively constructed but to the way in which it appears in each aesthetic experience. What instantaneously seems evident to us in the work of art in this sense is precisely incapable of definitive objectification; it is what is irreducible to a “demonstrat[ion] [of] the compelling forces of order." Aesthetic evidentness, understood in this way, is the manifestation of something essentially ungraspable: the manifestation of aesthetic semblance. And inasmuch as aesthetic evidentness is the name more specifically for those moments in the aesthetic experience at which the work seems to show itself in, as it were, an unmediated fashion, the experience of it should be described as a sudden17 experience of discontinuity and non-identity rather than as the continuous reconstruction of an artistic accomplishment of integration. In this sense, aesthetic evidentness is a necessary component of the process of aesthetic experience but not something like its objective point of reference or, thereby, its end.  

If all of this is correct, then the analysis of Luhmann's reflections on the dynamic of medium and form has led us not only to a distinctive feature of the aesthetic that transcends the various particular qualities of artistic means of representation, but simultaneously also—once again--to a different concept of aesthetic autonomy. Art is not autonomous because it commands a “unique and proper area of competence" that would then have to be defended against a presumed contamination of the arts by intermedial processes, or the uch-maligned "food Of images"' of the mass media, or other elements of the culture industry. Art is autonomous, rather, in and by virtue of the specific structure of the experience that corresponds to it--an experience that cannot be reduced either to consumerism or, on the other hand, to the perception of contingency. The definition of aesthetic autonomy in a theory of experience is not tied to the identification of somehow specifically aesthetic areas of competence; nor, however, can it be in any way anticipated from the side of production. The artist may “"demonstrate the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible,” or accomplish some other such thing, by creating a certain form. But he cannot anticipate the autonomy that the work develops only in and through the specificity of a. certain experience--the experience of a specifically aesthetic object relation for which the dynamic of medium and form, in the sense I have just explained, is constitutive. Of course, this reconception of aesthetic autonomy has far-reaching consequences for the assessment of contemporary art. For it is then no longer at all clear that the growing tendency since the sixties toward a transgression of the boundaries between the genres amounts in itself to a negation of the idea of aesthetic autonomy.  

![images/9e80c96ec5cffbeeeb3a00f16d5f3dc4e65f112215ee7fbc19881e86074a2d91.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/08Y8PL8.jpeg)  

Attempts to define aesthetic autonomy in terms of media aesthetics, however, seem to be on the defensive for simple empirical reasons. The boundaries between the genres, much like those between art and life, seem to have become porous since the sixties due to artistic developments as well as innovations in media technology employed both within art and outside of it. Considering such attempts, however, this very tendency seems to be merely another symptom of the previously diagnosed cultural decline against which some then seek with even greater urgency--to delineate an uncorrupted, “"unique and proper." and, in this sense, autonomous “area" of art. Still, such attempts have felt increasingly futile even to those who undertake them: in particular to its desperate advocates, the concept of media has long seemed to be owned by technologists--it seems no longer to have any particular significance for the main currents of contemporary art, and the idea of specific skills likewise generally no longer seems to be tied to it. In fact, the unsentimental farewell to art bid by new media theory is nothing more than the other side of this diagnosis.18 Aesthetically speaking, we live, writes Krauss, in a “postmedium condition":  

Surrounded everywhere by media, which is to say by the technologically relayed image, the aesthetic option of the medium has been declared outmoded, cashiered, washed-up, finished. Painting is a possibility we can barely remember; sculpture is so far in the past that it seems indifferent whether we weld in steel or cast in bronze; drawing seems obviously best left to computers.19 Yet art seems to find itself in this sense under pressure not only from outside. This is, from the perspective of the representatives of a notion of autonomy based in media aesthetics, the worst part: since the sixties, the decisive impulses of this development have come from the artistic movements themselves.  

Let us set aside the question whether the diagnosis that we now live in a “post-medium condition” is even correct. Even assuming that it is, we ought to take the futility of any attempt to defend a media-aesthetic concept of autonomy in the face of the developments described above not so much as proof of the valor of those lone warriors among the cultural critical hardliners who "nevertheless” and “precisely because” of these developments maintain their position, but rather as the symptom of the conceptual shortcomings of this concept of autonomy. The attempt to defend a field of aesthetic autonomy defined by an aesthetics of media must remain unsatisfactory not because, for example, an autonomous field of the aesthetic, previously neatly demarcated within the terrain of the various arts, has now unfortunately come under pressure in a worsening situation whose most perfidious expression is the corruption of the artistic movements themselves. On the contrary, this attempt must remain unsatisfactory because no aesthetic autonomy can be founded on an aesthetics of media, and for systematic reasons: the irreducible specificity of the individual arts should not be identified with certain characteristics of their material media——-as even Greenberg's most loyal disciples have demonstrated. Rather, as Fried and Krauss have argued, it is to be found in the artists′ historically changing engagement with their various aesthetic media. But, as will become clearer in the following chapter, a particularly media-reflective engagement does not in fact guarantee that genre boundaries will not be transgressed. That such transgression can be driven by motivations immanent to an art is demonstrated, or at least suggested, by the example of the history of modern painting with its unforeseen, its “perverse” offshoots in Minimal art. A reflective focus on the specific qualities of the aesthetic medium offers no protection against transgressions of the boundaries of an art-—-it can indeed motivate such transgressionnor is it by itself a specifically aesthetic issue, as Krauss has sometimes suggested.2 Medium reflectivity may indeed be a sign of artistic quality, just as a regard for the dimension of presentation distinguishes good academic work, or the technical mastery of the material as well as a reflection on it is now essential to any reasonably advanced advertising clip. But medium reflectivity is incapable of founding any "unique and proper area" of art or its autonomy. Where advocates of media aesthetics insist on a distinct field of medium specificity for an art or even an individual work of art, they seem to defend not so much the idea of aesthetic autonomy but rather a certain idea of pure art. The rejection of intermedial works as such on media-aesthetic grounds reveals the conservatism of this aesthetics, and recalls the reactionary's fear of all hybridity. Both with and against Luhmann, I have argued instead for a concept of aesthetic autonomy that ties it to the specific structure of aesthetic experience rather than to a “unique and proper area of competence." For this latter idea—-regardless whether it is articulated with respect to individual arts or specific works of art—-falls short of the conceptual task of substantiating aesthetic autonomy.  

This shift of terms, however, is not yet a satisfactory answer to an argument that adds yet another dimension to the dispute over the assessment of the rising tide of intermedial phenomena since the sixties. For one might object to the experience-theoretical approach on which my argument is based, and claim that by conceiving aesthetic autonomy in a way that transcends the specific qualities of the individual arts and even the concrete employment of media that constitutes the individual work of art, it merely uncritically reflects what the artistic movements purport-a development, culminating in Conceptual art, toward transcendence of the individual arts and therefore also of traditional works of art in the name of an idea of art as such. Thierry de Duve, for instance, writes about contemporary artistic movements from Conceptual art and Land art to performance art and Appropriation art:  

Varied as they are, all these movements have one thing in common: they pit themselves against painting, and sometimes against sculpture as well. What they have retained from the sixties is the authorization to produce generic art, that is, art that has severed its ties with the specific crafts and traditions of either painting or sculpture.21  

Whereas Krauss, believing herself to be in agreement with de Duve, bemoans this situation, the latter himself, as a Duchampian, is far from endorsing a nostalgia--which, although fractured, can be found in its rudimentary form in Krauss-—that longs for the craft, the skill, the traditional talents of an elect artistry, and the smell of the studio. What is at issue in this context for de Duve is the more fundamental question about the interrelation between the particular arts and art in general. Duve is interested, he writes, in the relationships between the “specific” and the “generic." This entails questions that are, he writes, “art historical, critical, \*theoretical,' and, ultimately, ethical."22  

As with the conflict over the theatricality of Minimal art, the debates over the correct assessment of artistic phenomena since the sixties that transgress traditional boundaries seem to be not only about questions of aesthetic value. Whether the frontline runs between entertainment and autonomy or between the “generic” and the "'specific” (or the general and the particular), a dispute over the good life is implicit in it that, in the course of the seventies and eighties, increasingly coincided with debates over the relationship between modernism and postmodernism. In order to examine this set of issues more closely, I would like to make a detour by reading a text that took a quite different approach to the problem of the interrelation between the general idea of art and the particularities of the individual arts in light of the artistic transgressions of the sixties: Theodor W. Adorno's "Art and the Arts." a text that has moreover been discussed, in view of the intermedial phenomena of contemporary art, as a promising approach to an“interdisciplinary aesthetic."23  

# 2.2.  

Contrary to Krauss's interpretation of his work, de Duve was in no way the \* Jeremiah" of the eighties.2+ as Michael Fried was for the seventies, warning unbelievers about enemy attacks of "postmediality." In fact, de Duve recognizes in the self-transgression of the individual arts toward a general idea of art a decisive aspect of aesthetic modernism.25 Yet in this respect his position resembles not that of the Greenbergian Fried. but that of another protagonist of modern (or rather, modernist) aesthetic discourse—-Theodor W. Adorno. Despite their shared antagonism against objecthood, kitsch, and the culture industry, Adorno, or so it would seem at first. arrives at a quite different assessment of intermedial phenomena than Greenberg.  

"Immunity to the zeitgeist is no virtue in itself, Adorno writes in his essay "Art and the Arts," first published in 1967. The barb is aimed against the conservative defensive reactions triggered by recent developments toward--as Adorno calls it--an "'erosion" or "fraying"26 of the boundaries between the genres in art.27 Unlike Fried, who, in the same year, seeks to immunize himself against this very zeitgeist with an idea of art that could be \*"meaningful, or wholly meaningful, only within the individual arts" (A0, 142), Adorno recognizes in the tendency toward fraying in the arts, as well as in the aesthetic “grasping\* toward non-aesthetic reality-that is, the rebellion of the work of art against its traditional definition—nothing less than “the element of all authentically modern art" (AaA, 386). Where Fried diagnoses a break with the principles of the aesthetic project of modernity, Adorno sees the faithful further development of that project. Whereas Fried, following Greenberg, insists that art can only survive by keeping the genres strictly separate—-since only such separation offers protection against the risk of degenerating into entertainmentAdorno recognizes a resistance against “culinary” use in precisely this movement of art against its preconceived classification and into the various arts (AaA, 371). Quite unlike the New York modernist camp, Adorno sees in the trend toward a “blurring of the clean division between different genres of art' less the end of the autonomy of art than, on the contrary, its salvation from the embrace, fatal in the long run, by the selfappointed “friends of the arts.” For, according to Adorno, the “plural, touchingly philistine [...] sheds light on the subject"—the arts appear to the “friends of the arts" as nothing more than “a profusion of goods on display for the contemplative observer, from the kitchen to the lounge [...] that are then inspected and sampled" (AaA, 371). For Adorno as for de Duve, the modernist avant-garde is distinguished by a resistance to any given “context of aesthetic expectations” (de Duve) that decides what is still and what is no longer art. The subdivision of art into the arts appears in this context as one of the most stubborn conventions from which art must free itself for the sake of its autarky, indeed its autonomy. The avant-garde, Adorno writes, took "the philistine question Is that still ... ?' [...] quite literally"" (AaA, 370). And it answered with an art that no longer wishes to be art in the sense of the preconceived specific generic categories established for it. In 1967, Adorno is thinking of the sound montages by the Italian composer Franco Donatoni, Gyorgy Ligeti's Atmospheres, as well as Hans G. Helms's serially organized prose, the partial temporalization of sculpture in Alexander Calder's mobiles, and the tendency toward spatialization in Bernhard Schulze's paintings.  

The development toward the fraying of the arts, however, is in Adorno's interpretation—-and this, as we will see, leads to a certain rapprochement between his position and that of his American colleagues—-not the result of a sudden generational ignorance toward the medium specificity of the various arts. In contrast with de Duve, who is concerned with the “postmedial” situation of art after Duchamp-. something we will come back to in 2.2.3—-Adorno is defending merely a movement motivated by the internal logic of development of the individual arts themselves. The convergence of the individual arts in the sixties, according to Adorno, is an essential consequence of an engagement with the particular problems internal to each art. Based on the fact that the development toward fraying in the arts is motivated by an engagement with each individual arts′ immanent problems rather than, as it were. enjoined upon the individual arts from the outside as well, Adorno then distinguishes this development from the art of the Romantics, who demanded the unification of the genres of art into one art, primarily in the name of a subjectivity that would be equally at work in each of the arts:  

Works of art became the impression of a soul--one that was not necessarily identical with that of the composer. It was the language of the self freely expressing itself. This idea brought the arts closer to one another. It could no doubt be shown that the same soul animates all the different arts. But their boundaries were scarcely weakened by this. They remained what they were, and this disparateness is not the least important critical reason for the most recent development.(AaA, 374-5)  

As a development motivated by a critical engagement of the internal logic of each individual art itself, the tendency toward fraying in the sixties, claims Adorno, is different not only from the art of the Romantic era but also from any "inclination toward the Gesamtkunstwerk."28 For what Adorno calls fraying does not, properly speaking, aim at a unification of the arts. The artists of the sixties did not plan the convergence of the arts as such; nor does this convergence entail an attempt to synthesize the arts. This fact alone marks a fundamental distance between this movement and the idea of the gesamtkunstwerk. For this idea, according to Adorno, violently seeks to undo what indeed cannot be undone, namely the historical differentiation of the arts with their specific media. But Adorno sees yet another reason why the development toward a fraying of genre boundaries in the sixties must not be associated with the unifying ideology of the  

gesamtkunstwerk. The idea of a unification of the arts is problematic in Adorno's eyes not only because it implies a false unity——-false because it is inadequate in light of the historical situation——-it is problematic also because this unity in all its actual forms has always only been realized as false unity: by power of the mutual subjugation of the means of representation involved. Adorno had previously criticized this double problem in Wagner's “music drama." As he writes in his In Search of Wagner:  

In the contingent experience of individual bourgeois existence the separate senses do not unite to create a totality, a unified and guaranteed world of essences. It is questionable, indeed, whether such a unity of sense experience has ever existed, dependent on it as Wagner's disillusioned mind may be. On the contrary, the senses, which all have a different history, end up poles apart from each other, as a consequence of the growing reification of reality as well as of the division of labor. For this not only separates men from each other but also divides each man in himself. It is for this reason that the music drama proves unable to assign meaningful functions to different arts. Its form, therefore, is that of a spurious identity. Music, scene and words are integrated only in the sense that the author--the freakishness of his position is well suggested by the term “"poet-composer"--treats them as if they all converged on the same goal. But he only achieves this by doing them violence and hence distorting the whole, which ends up in tautology, as permanent over-determination. The music repeats what the words have already said and the more it pushes itself to the fore the more superfluous it becomes, when measured against the meaning it is supposed to express. And this in turn affects the integrity of the music. The very attempt to adapt the arts to each other disrupts the unity of the compositional structure. [...I The closer and the more indiscreetly the different arts are brought into proximity, and the more the music drama approaches their fundamental indifference to each other, the more they prove mutually disruptive.29  

We should not underestimate the importance of the fact that Adorno offers his praise of very recent developments toward a fraying of genres against the backdrop of a critique of the gesamtkunstwerk. In fact. this praise is always tied to a critique of the "failed dream? of the "convergence [of the aesthetic media] as abstract utopia."30 A closer examination of this systematic nexus suggests what we might learn from Adorno for an assessment of the proliferation of the intermedial in contemporary art. The reference to the "principle of the division of labor" in Adorno's critique of Wagner conspicuously indicates the interweaving of philosophical, artistic, and social developments in his argument. But the connections between this argument and that in ""Art and the Arts" have not yet to my mind been sufficiently explored. Instead, "Art and the Arts" has been read as documenting that the mellowing "late" Adorno had a more open mind for contemporary phenomena, if not even as evidence of a revision of his aesthetic dogmas, founded in the philosophy of history, which Adorno had laid out prominently in his Philosophy of New Music. I think, on the contrary, that Adorno's later text on fraying remains completely in line with this older set of arguments, and should thus not be misunderstood as a first step toward its revision or toward its productive destabilization on the way toward a "post-avant-garde” aesthetics.31 In order to demonstrate this claim, I will first broadly reconstruct certain arguments that are essential for the present context. In a second step, I will then discuss their consequences for the art critical interpretation of intermedial art.

Like Greenberg, Adorno also tells a story of progress. Unlike Greenberg, however, Adorno sees the movement toward a fraying of  

30 Adorno lays out an argument similar to that of "Art and the Arts" in "On Some Relationships between Music and Painting," trans. Susan H. Gillespie, The Musical Quarterly 79, no. 1 (Spring 1995): 74. Abbreviated in the follow ing as RMP.   
31 This is the rather influential claim made by Christine Eichel in Vom Ermatten der AvantgardezurVernetzung derKinste,esp.27-54.  

generic boundaries as a continuation of that story rather than its decay. He ties his notion of aesthetic progress to the dimensions of aesthetic “productive forces” and aesthetic “material." The concept of aesthetic material in Adorno, however, refers not, as one might think, to the material qualities of the various aesthetic media or means of representation. Rather, aesthetic material denotes the principles of construction engendered over the course of history in relation to each of the various aesthetic media, principles which the significant works of any given period--and in Adorno this means, among other things, works conscious of their own place in historyare called upon to advance and develop.32 According to Adorno, we cannot speak about aesthetic material irrespective of historically emergent forms or constructions of form.33 Material exists as aesthetic material only in each individual form. His discourse of a progress in terms of the aesthetic material makes sense only on the basis of this quasi-Luhmannian premise. In Adorno's view, successful works are those that build on the previous historical progress of aesthetic principles of construction, and do so in such a way that the previous state of the aesthetic material is not merely reflected affirmatively but developed further in a critical engagement with that material. More precisely, successful works are those that realize what had already been implicit in the previous principles of aesthetic production, but which had led to the eventual failure of these principles and the works associated with them. In his Aesthetic Theory, Adorno writes:  

The socially most advanced level of the productive forces, one of which is consciousness, is the level of the problem posed at the interior of the aesthetic monad. In their own figuration, artworks indicate the solution to this problem, which they are unable to provide on their own without intervention; this alone is legitimate tradition in art. Each and every important work of art leaves traces behind in its material and technique, and following them defines the modern as what needs to be done, which is contrary to having a nose for what is in the air. Critique makes this definition concrete. The traces to be found in the material and the technical procedures, from which every qualitatively new work takes its lead, are scars: They are the loci at which the preceding works misfired. By laboring on them, the new work turns against those that left these traces behind; this, not shifts in subjective feelings for life or in established styles, is the actual object of what historicism treated as the generational problem in art.34  

In this sense, the importance of a work of art is a function of its position vis-a-vis the dynamically determined historical state of the aesthetic material; that is, of its relation to the state of the historically acquired possibilities of aesthetic production. How high a work of art ranks, Adorno also emphasizes in "Art and the Arts," is thus independent of the position of its genre in any of the systems--be they hierarchical (e.g., Schopenhauer) or historical-dialectical (e.g., Hegel) that philosophy produced in the attempt to synthesize the heterogeneous diversity of the arts; yet it is independent also of "its historical position in the sense that the later work" is by no means eo ipso "superior" (AaA, 372).3s Its value is measured, according to Adorno, only by the either reactionary or progressive relation of its technique to the state that the aesthetic material had attained in its time.36 However one may determine this state for any given moment in history (I will come back to this problem later): in any case, it is—-quite in line with the model of progress I have just sketched—-the progressive-critical and, in this sense, immanent engagement of the arts with their respective state of the material that Adorno claims is responsible in the sixties for what he considers the movement, as legitimate as it is necessary, of the individual arts toward their synthesis in an “idea of art as such" (AaA, 373).  

For, according to Adorno, this movement will inevitably lose all energy and purpose without such an engagement with concrete  

problems of construction—an engagement, moreover, that is tied back to material. As a consequence, Adorno strictly distinguishes the movement toward a fraying of the genres not only from the art of the Romantics and from the ideology of the gesamtkunstwerk but also, and even more fundamentally, from all attempts at a sublimation of art that are not sufficiently mediated by a thorough engagement of the current state of aesthetic material. Because aesthetic material can be constituted as aesthetic solely in form, Adorno writes, only the most serious work on the most advanced principles of formal construction can do justice to one absolutely ineluctable problem of artistic production: that of the material side of art. However legitimate the call for sublimation as a reaction to the “culinary” fetishization of the sensual charms of the work of art may be-and Adorno's own perspective may in fact at first suggest this-—-it becomes just as problematic inasmuch as it ignores the fact that works of art nonetheless need material support in order to be realized at all. \*"The more rigorously and ruthlessly [works of art] insist on their spiritualization," Adorno warns, “the further they distance themselves from what is supposed to be made spiritual? (AaA, 373)—from the sensuous material. The ultimate consequence, writes Adorno, is that a void opens up in the works between the intended “spirit” and the support (AaA, 373) that can only be closed by conventions or a dubious belief in the immediate symbolic value of colors and notes; by means, that is to say, that unwittingly lead art back toward the decorative arts from which it had sought to dissociate itself. Adorno refers to Kandinsky's manifesto Concerning the Spiritual in Art as the earliest testament to such a falsely abstract tendency toward sublimation accompanied by a reversion to the spiritlessness of decoration.37 \*It is not for nothing.?”' says Adorno about this text, “"that in it technical reciprocity replaces a symbiosis of the arts or their agglomeration in the cause of some intensified effect or other” (AaA, 372).  

Yet for Adorno that which marks the proximity between Kandinsky's artistic program and Romantic ideology or the ideology of the  

gesamtkunstwerk, the false abstraction of the \*"spiritual from the material, has consequences that, he writes, go beyond the subjective problem of an individual \*bad" artist. In his model, the danger of a reversion of the tendency toward sublimation into spiritlessness is, as it were, the goad that drives the historical developmental tendency of modern art in general. For this danger concerns the relation of construction and material as such. The project to be pursued via an engagement of the state of aesthetic material, the project of, as Adorno puts it. the "most authentic" art of any era, is then nothing other than the attempt to preserve art from such a reversal by critically working on this relation.  

This also implies a first indication as to what is truly at stake in Adorno's judgments about modern art, grounded as they are in a theory of progress. The idea of aesthetic progress serves Adorno not only as a philosophical foundation for criteria of artistic advancedness but at the same time also helps him define aesthetic autonomy. Without a more precise understanding of this motivation, I think, the actual point of Adorno's idea of progress will remain obscure. I would therefore like to explain in greater detail what the danger of a reversion of increasing sublimation of art into spiritlessness means. For this danger makes the category of progress more than just a criterion of artistic quality-—-it turns it into a necessity if autonomous art is to survive at all.  

The tendency toward "sublimation,” according to Adorno, is by no means merely a contingent feature of modernist art-—-it is inscribed at its core. Like bourgeois society, modernist art, too, obeys the principle of progressive rationalization. Elsewhere and with reference to developments in music, Adorno writes: \*The core concept that set the more recent history of music in motion [is] that of rationality, which is inseparable from that of the social domination of nature without and within the human being."38 Adorno has no objection to the central role technical rationality plays in the artistic procedures of modernism in music and elsewhere. On the contrary, art can only unfold its potential for resistance to the dominance of instrumental reason if it is rational, and not by ideologically declaring itself to be a refuge of the irrational in a thoroughly rationalized world. Adorno recognizes the potential for aesthetic rationality to offer resistance against the violent aspects of instrumental reason in its relation to mimesis.3 Mimesis in Adorno, as Albrecht Wellmer has summarized, is the “name given to those forms of behaviour of living beings which are sensually receptive, expressive and communicative. It is in art," Wellmer continues, “that mimetic forms of behaviour have been preserved as spiritual ones in the course of the development of civilization. Art is a form of mimesis that has become spiritualized; that is, it has become transformed and objectified by rationality."4 Spirit as the agent of “reconciliation" in Adorno is therefore not only the medium of an art that nonviolently synthesizes what is dispersed; it is at the same time its vanishing point and its utopia, the epitome of its relation to truth.41  

Yet art, according to Adorno, is true—-that is, spiritual in the correct   
sense, that of reconciliation—-in two dialectically interrelated ways:   
as aesthetic coherence and as the bringing-to-appearance of reality. In   
the passage already cited, Wellmer has succinctly reconstructed this   
dialectical core idea in Adorno's aesthetics as follows: art, as the sphere of seeming reconciliation, I...] is by definition the Other, the negation of an unreconciled reality. Art can thus be true in the sense of being faithful to reality to the extent that it shows reality as unreconciled, antagonistic, divided against itself. But it can only do this by showing reality in the light of reconciliation,  

i.e. by the non-violent aesthetic synthesis of disparate elements that produces the semblance of reconciliation. This means, however, that an antinomy is carried into the very heart of aesthetic synthesis—which can by definition only succeed by turning against itself and questioning its own underlying principle, for the sake of the truth which nevertheless cannot be extracted except by recourse to this very principle. [...] This antinomial structure of art is present from the very outset in the historical separation of image from sign, of non-conceptual from conceptual syntheses, even if the conscious awareness of it only becomes apparent in the art of the modern world, i.e. under conditions of fully developed instrumental rationality. It is inherent within the idea of art that it must turn against its own principle and become a rebellion against aesthetic semblance.42  

In short, as Adorno puts it: \*The negation of synthesis becomes a principle of form."43  What this paradoxical formula is saying,"\* again, this is, Wellmer,  

is that art can only survive and remain authentic if it succeeds in articulating the negation of synthesis as its aesthetic meaning, and in bringing about aesthetic synthesis in the very process of negating it. The modern work of art must, in a single pass, both produce and negate aesthetic meaning; it must articulate meaning as the negation of meaning, balancing, so to speak, on the razor's edge between affirmative semblance and an anti-art that is bereft ofsemblance.44  

Because aesthetic spirit, conceived as the content of the work in polemical antagonism against an unreconciled reality, is to be had only via the principle of the constitution of form, of constructionthis is the basis of the primacy of construction in artistic productionthe danger arises that form (aesthetic spirit I) becomes independent of its content (aesthetic spirit IH), thereby effacing it, when the negation of the construction of form in and by power of that construction fails. This occurs, for instance, when the principles of the construction of form have been rationalized to such a degree that they become available as conventions whose virtuosic mastery itself subsequently becomes the be-all and end-all of artistic production. For at this moment the principle of construction becomes independent of what is to be constructed, of the individual material. The consequence is expressed, according to Adorno, in the very idea of "mastering the material' when the principle of construction is imposed on individual elements. This “mastering” then takes the place of a production that non-violently foliows the impulses of the elements in the process of their integration such that formal coherence emerges as much from these impulses themselves as these impulses must necessarily remain alien to, even object to, such coherence.45 In absolute mastery over the material, however, the rationality of construction gains the upper hand, as it were, over its “polar opposite,” the “mimetic impulses” inherent in the material it organizes.\* The immanent process, working against itself, that is aesthetic form as spiritual form, ceases to inhabit such works--the consequence being that the spirit of the work is dialectically reversed into spiritlessness. This is also Adorno's explanation for the fact that works can lose their tension, such as the now merely decorative abstract paintings that even in Adorno's time had already graced the wails of executive offices of major corporations.  

For Adorno, when the principle of construction becomes independent of its material, absolute mastery over the material converges with its opposite—the belief in the pure material. In the one case, the material, having lost all power of resistance under the blind dominance of absolute artistic control, is surrendered to “culinary” use. In the other case—-when it is fetishized as pure material—-it, a priori, remains untouched by any form of spiritualization. In "Art and the Arts" Adornowrites:  

The primacy of context that is created in the material by the principle of construction is converted by this domination through the spirit into the loss of spirit. namely of intrinsic meaning. From that point on, all art suffers from this contradiction, and the most serious art suffers the most painfully. Spiritualization, the rational manipulation of artistic methods, seems to drive out spirit as the substantive content of art. What set out to spiritualize the material of art ends up in the naked material as if in a mere existent, just as was explicitly called for by a number of schools-—-in music, by John Cage, for example. (AaA, 373)  

Adorno's concept of autonomous art and the resulting judgments of aesthetic value are certainly impressively compelling and attractively complex. But the assumption of a dialectical unity of form (aesthetic spirit I) and content (aesthetic spirit I1), as Wellmer has already pointed out in his critique of Adorno, is no more self-evident than the mutual referential interrelation of reality, art, and utopia that, according to Adorno. must be deciphered in all art by the dialectical mediation of form and content sketched above. As soon as we stop basing actual viewings of concrete works of art on the presupposition of such referential interrelation, Adorno's claims concerning the dialectical relation between form and content may also no longer be immediately plausible. Once we no longer conceive the processes of aesthetic understanding as the reconstruction of a referential relation presupposed by a certain philosophy to be present in all art, and instead tie these processes to questions of the interpretation of each individual work, what inevitably emerges is that the coherence of individual elements in the aesthetic form as such need not already imply reconciliation. Such interpretation is in fact nothing but the concrete projection of a philosophy that -for all art-decides ahead of time what it will seek to find in the individual works, namely its own concept of aesthetic spirit, or rather, of aesthetic truth.47 Yet the idea that a work of art ought to be capable of being deciphered with a view to the referential interrelation of reality, art, and utopia, presupposes not only that the coherence of the elements in the aesthetic form as such must always already be charged with a certain content ("reconciliation"). It also presumes that the immanent process that is aesthetic form as spiritual form, is a fact that is merely waiting to be grasped or reconstructed by the receiving subject in a more or less suitable way, and this means for Adorno, as philosophically as possible.  

In this respect, I think that even the notion that the successful aesthetic form “objectivates"“mimetic impulses" of the material contains a problem—-however, not necessarily with regard to the somewhat mystifying image that Adorno paints in this context of the sensitive artist, who almost interpassively follows the “mimetic impulses" of his material. For this reference to a dynamic in artistic production in which the internal logic of "the thing itself' surpasses the artist's intention is in fact corroborated by the self-description of artists who organize their own material. And it may more generally be quite a good image for a largely unalienated process of production. In light of Cage's aleatorics and the industrially fabricated boxes of Minimal art, however, the decisive question for art criticism and theory is whether this——-the fact that art comes into being in such a way--is relevant for the notion of art. Adorno rather obviously assumes that it is,\*\* presupposing, however—and here lies the central problem——that the “impulses” of the material, which the sensitive artist follows, can be objectified in the successful aesthetic form and can therefore also be reconstructed as such by the receiving subject as it contemplates the work.  

In the context of my discussion of Fried and Luhmann, I have already argued against the reduction of the experience of art to the mere reconstruction--however sensitiveof the process of production that works of art are accessible to the receiving subject only in and through a specific experience of the self-reflective and performative constitution of interrelations-an experience that, in principle, remains forever incomplete because the works themselves can never vouch for such interrelations. The consequence, however, is that the relation of form (aesthetic spirit I) and content (aesthetic spirit II) can never be guaranteed on the side of production—-no matter how much  

the artist strives to be true to the material. Adorno's idea, according to which the most serious artworks by means of ever new formations of internally antagonistic interrelations to keep the two poles of the aesthetic spirit together safeguard against reversion into spiritlessness-—-at any time-—-seems misleading from the perspective of a theory of aesthetic experience. For. from this perspective, the two poles of the aesthetic spirit are always already separated from one another, irrespective of whether the aesthetic form appears internally antagonistic or harmonious, whether it has been produced in the spirit of Adorno or in that of Kandinsky: if we do not want to misconceive aesthetic understanding in objectivistic terms as a mere reconstruction, then the receiving subject necessarily enters between the two poles, that is. between aesthetic form and aesthetic content.\* Yet, this subject is not. properly speaking, a "mediating instance"50 between form and content. It is, rather, the center of forces in a process not in fact entirely subject to its control that plays back and forth on the object between materiality and meaning; a process that cannot be arrested either in the supposed facticity of form or in any particular content, or in any particular hypothesis--no matter how dialectical-- regarding their mediation. What it means to underestimate the peculiar productivity of what we have so far discussed under the title "aesthetic experience” is perhaps most strikingly manifest in those artistic phenomena that, from Adorno's perspective, cannot possibly be called art because they fall short--a priori, as it were--of the dialectical problem of formal creation: John Cage's aleatory procedures, for example. Adorno writes elsewhere:  

What art becomes, depends on whether its progress retains power over the regressive element, or whether it succumbs to it with the barbaric literalness that triumphs equally in the cult of absolute methods or of absolute material. One cannot fail to hear such regression, which does not transform the concept of art into something higher, in many products of the most recent musical practice; it would not surprise the musician if complementary  

things were to be reported about painting. (RMP, 78) As we know, complementary reports indeed emerged at the same time from the world of visual arts. It is not by chance that Adorno's critique of the regressive literalness of Cage's experiments and other phenomena of the "most recent musical practice" recalls Fried's arguments against Donald Judd's programmatic call for the positivism of "specific objects" (see 1.2). Adorno's objection to "the regression of artworks to the barbaric literalness of what is aesthetically the case's1 does indeed bear a relation to Fried's objection against the literalness of Minimalism. Fried's quest in the field of the visual arts, as much as Adorno's in that of music is to save art from the reversal into, respectively, literalness or spiritlessness. For Adorno as well as for Fried, the viability of autonomous art, and with it of the modern project, depends on preserving art from this fateeven if the two give very different answers to the question of how this project can be kept alive in the face of such a threat.  

With respect to the critique of aesthetic literalness, however, our discussion of Fried has shown that, aesthetically speaking, there is no such thing as pure or literal material. The structure of the aesthetic experience of Minimalist art instead revealed that the positivist program of the Minimalists arguing along the lines defined by Judd was a self-misconception. A similar argument could be made for John Cage's music.52 The material can be neither sublated in symbolic meaning (Kandinsky) nor, on the other hand, grasped as such, in its “pure existence” (Cage, Judd). We have seen that “spirit” and "letter”"— meaning and material—-exist in the aesthetic experience only in dynamic and antagonistic interrelation. From the perspective of experience, art is constitutively processual not because the individual elements emancipate themselves objectively, as it were, in a suitable form of mutual antagonism, but because the coherence of their interrelations can never be conclusively evident on or in the work to the subject of the aesthetic experience. This, if anything at all, emancipates the elements of the work of art and allows for a process in which they can develop productive as well as destructive impulses in relation to the individual context in which they are placed. Now, such a release of what Adorno judges to be “spiritless” aesthetic objects from the symbolism or positivism of the programs that motivated them inevitably calls into question not only the criteria on which Adorno bases his judgments about works of modern art. The very introduction of questions of an aesthetics of reception into the broadest sense into Adorno's work aesthetic---which ultimately argues in terms of an aesthetics of production--affects the progress hypothesis at its systematic roots. Against the backdrop of these questions. the supposition of a coherence of referential interrelations between reality. art, and utopia—-interrelations that the subject of aesthetic experience merely needs to reconstruct more or less adequately——-must appear as questionable as the notion, motivated by this supposition, of the dialectical unity of form and content, which in turn grounds Adorno's progress-theoretical conception of aesthetic autonomy.  

Before coming back to the critique of this set of arguments (2.2.3), however. I would first like to show in greater detail that and how these arguments also underlie Adorno's praise for the fraying of the boundaries between genres and how this functions. I will show that because of its embeddedness in a theory of progress, this praise should by no means be read as advocating a principled affirmation of intermedial procedures in art.s3  

# 2.2. . 2. Progress and "Fraying"  

Once again, then: good works of moderm art, according to Adorno, are generally those that, by working on what went awry in previous works, continue the project implicit in these works. And this project, as Adorno conceives it, consists for all modern art in articulating  

the negation of aesthetic construction as aesthetic meaning and, in the same gesture, by putting aesthetic construction into effect through its negation. Only in this way can art maintain its autonomy, and protect its “spirit" from the reversion into spiritlessness. In practice, however, negation of the aesthetic construction means negation of every principle of construction that has become stabilized by conventions, and has thereby lost its tension. Accordingly, the negation of the conventions of formal creation established for and by the traditional definitions of the genres is what, according to Adorno, motivated the fraying ofgenres'boundaries.  

As he often does, Adorno uses the example of music to illustrate   
his point; and, as he also often does, he begins his considerations   
with Schoenberg. In a continuation of the integral processes incorpo  
rating all compositional dimensions for the production of musical co  
herence pioneered by Schoenberg, the development of music took a   
step of "unforeseeable significance”--a step in the direction of what   
Adorno had programmatically called “musique informelle” only a   
few years earlier in 1961.54 This step consists, writes Adorno, in separating [Schoenberg's] concept of musical coherence from its traditional assumptions and thereby from everything that had accreted historically in the concept of music. Thus music had even become allergic to such cohesive techniques as free atonality and twelve-tone technique, in which the trained ear could still hear the traces of the tonality that such techniques repudiated. It could therefore freely face up to the concept of coherence, independently of the limited shapes that the concept had assumed and that had become an ingrained part of our hearing. The entire output of Stockhausen can be regarded as an attempt to test musical coherence in a multidimensional continuum. Such sovereign dominance, which makes it possible to establish coherence even in an incalculable variety of dimensions, creates from the inside the link between music and the visual arts, architecture, sculpture,  

and painting. The more the coherence-creating methods of the individual arts spread their tentacles over the traditional stock of forms and become formalized, as it were, the more the different arts are subjected to a principle of uniformity. (AaA, 374)  

A principle of uniformity-—here, that means a general idea of art. Nonetheless, this idea, as was already suggested above, can never be had in abstraction and as such. This shows that Adorno was an early critic of that radicalized tendency toward the “generic" in art, which was represented, according to Thierry de Duve, first and foremost by the Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth.ss In 1973, Kosuth had tautologically equated the idea of art with art, and dismissed its concrete realization as irrelevant.\$6 Yet, simply pointing to the fact that the material execution of Kosuth's installations is not at all irrelevant but in fact constitutive of their idea, demonstrates that Kosuth commits a performative self-contradiction and suffers from an intentionalist self-misconception.57 In general, those works that have been grouped under the title of a “dematerialization of the art object"s8 —Conceptual art (art-as-idea) and the happening (art-asaction)-depend on a material realization that is certainly not arbitrary. be it in the form of the performance itself or its documentation (in the case of the happening), or in the form of the presentation of an idea (in the case of Conceptual art). The dependence of even these art forms on a material realization is a consequence not of a compromising accommodation to the art business, which demands marketable objects, but of the fact that there can be no art without aesthetic judgment, which in turn is necessarily dependent on public objects.59 Whereas de Duve defends this necessity that there be aesthetic objects against Kosuth's programmatic statements from a post-Kantian perspective, for Adorno, and this is decisive for the  

present argument, there is more at stake than this basic point. He seeks to defend not only the general claim that without material realization there exists not even an idea of art,6 but also the much more farreaching claim that true art exists only where construction releases the material stratum of the work of art in and through itself. Such a release, in turn, following Adorno's now familiar claim, can succeed only in a critical engagement of the current state of the aesthetic material in question. Only here, in an engagement of the problems of construction critically directed against the existing state of artistic production and its conventions, asserts Adorno, can the problem of the material layer of art be transformed into a legitimate claim of thatlayervis $\cdot\dot{a}$ -vis construction. For Adorno, such a state, however, can exist only in reference to each of the individual arts.  

This argumentative nexus defines what Adorno calls the “dual stance of art toward its forms." \*Its dialectical nature," he writes, "consists in the fact that [art] can carry out its movement toward unity solely by passing through multiplicity. Otherwise, its movement would be abstract and futile” (AaA, 383). The multiplicity Adorno speaks of here is the countable multiplicity of the arts and precisely not the innumerable multiplicity of individual works, and not merely because Adorno could not have foreseen the radicalism of the developments toward the individualization of the work of art-—-developments whose beginnings he describes in the example of the phenomenon of fraying. In fact, this limitation implies one of the central points of Adorno's (art) critical theory.  

Now, it is not immediately plausible that Adorno would tie his concept of art in such a way to the traditional arts, given the obvious contrast between his position and that of his American colleagues. For art cannot become or remain autonomous, according to Adorno, by an attempt to insulate the individual arts against empirical reality, by insisting, for instance, on their own \*unique and proper area of competence,” which can be secured only by dogmatically defending the conventional genre definitions--as both Greenberg and Fried  

advocate. In fact, Adorno proposes the exact antithesis: only by negating the conventional positive definition of art, only as a \*"rebellion against aesthetic semblance." can art preserve its authentic existence. Only by attempting to shed what is art-like about art, and shed also its meaningfulness, which has itself congealed into a "culinary feature'"---only by virtue of this negation can art preserve and expand its existence as art uncorrupted in its meaningfulness. This negation of aesthetic meaning, however, must not be misunderstood as an abstract negation. for to do so would amount to the self-abolition of art. No work of art is conceivable, claims Adorno, that “does not create meaning after all while "[turning] against its own meaningfulness as a totality" (AaA, 385). Accordingly, it is also the determinate negation of what positively counts as art that forms, according to Adorno. the "intrinsic [law] (AaA, 386) in accordance with which, in the sixties. even the rigid definitions of the genres could ultimately become an object of critique:  

The erosion [ Verfransung] of the arts is hostile to an ideal of harmony that presupposes, as the guarantee of meaning, what we might call ordered circumstances within the kinds of art. This erosion of the arts wishes to escape from the ideological basis of art, which reaches right down into its constitution as art, as an autarkic sphere of the spirit. It is as if the artistic genres, by denying their own firm boundaries, were gnawing away at the concept of art itself.(AaA,384-5)  

This is also the context for Adorno's affirmation--quite remarkable, given his general aesthetic preferences-of the "principle of montage” as the "original example of the erosion of art." Montage, according to Adorno, “amounts to the disruption, and hence the denial, of meaning in works of art through the invasion of fragments of empirical reality that do not abide by the laws of art" (AaA, 385).61  

But such an invasion, and this is important in the present context, must never become total-—as it does, for example, in the readymade. As much as the tendency toward a fraying of the boundaries of the genres, the invasion of reality into art is legitimate only when it remains bound to an engagement of the conventions of formal creation within each of the individual arts. Accordingly, the readymade, as a clean break from the traditional genres, marks a qualitative leap against which Adorno's writings labor-—-and on this front, he finds himself in the company of Greenberg, Fried, and Krauss.° The relation between art and the arts in Adorno is defined by a programmatic tension: the works do justice to the concept of autonomous art only by virtue of their conflict with the definition of their genre. But they must not break altogether free of this conflicting relationship. On the contrary, precisely the most critical engagement of the genre-specific tradition, according to Adorno, will in the end prove tobe thegreatest fidelity to it.63  

In a certain respect, the facts support this claim. In this last sense in particular, Adorno's hypotheses on the fraying of the genres accurately describe the historical fact that arts open up toward one another at the very moment—-or, at least, at the possibility-—-of breaking free from their representational function and increasingly reflect and focus on their respective means of representation.64 The result of this process of refection, a reflection that has become more trenchant in modernism, is indeed that the musicalization of music, the theatricalization of theater, the reflection on the painterly in painting, etc., have reflectively led the arts to open up toward one another. And this opening-up proves, upon closer examination, an opening-up only in the sense that it is implicit to the reflection upon the specificity: of the means of representation of each of the arts. For what emerges first and foremost in such reflection is what we might call the constitutive role intermediality plays for the specificity of the means of representation of each of the arts.6 For illustrations of what this means, the reader need only think of, for example, the graphic quality of writing brought to the fore by concrete poetry, of the phonic aspect of words as it comes to the surface in works such as Finnegans Wake, or, with Adorno, of the graphical quality of musical notation or the sculptural quality of the canvas that becomes thematic in Frank Steila's Shaped Canvases. These qualities may be emphasized by individual works, as in certain works from the sixties, but they are also present where they are not emphasized. They are constitutive of the specificity of each means of representation and therefore also of each of the arts. “In every art form," as Martin Seel has put so succinctly, \*"there are numerous intrinsic relationships to other arts, although not every art maintains them to every other art. These relationships are not something by virtue of which the genre under consideration can be expanded; they are fundamental for its constitution as one artistic genre among others."66  

This, the emergence of the intermediality fundamental to the individual arts, is obviously what Adorno has in mind when he notes that the very developmental logic of the individual arts motivates the tendency toward a fraying of the boundaries of the genres: “The arts converge," he writes elsewhere, "only where each pursues its immanent principle in a pure way" (RMP, 67). This process of reflection on the relationships among the various aesthetic media, constitutive of the specificity of each individual art, has certainly not left the notion of a neat separation of the genres untouched. But for Adorno. and I think he is right about this point, this does not at all mean  

that the structural differences between the aesthetic media associated with traditional artistic genres disappear. The fact that no art plays the same fundamental role for every other art clearly indicates that artistic transgressions of rigid definitions of traditional genres do not simply make the structural differences between aesthetic media associated with these genres disappear. On the contrary, these differences emerge in a new way. The transgression of the conventions of formal creation valid within the framework of traditional definitions of genre obviously does not lead to the abolition of the idea of medium specificity but to its liberation from the grip of the idea of genre-specificity. That is why I also believe that it is misleading to speak, as Krauss does, of a “post-medium condition” with respect to intermedial phenomena. Intermediality should not be misunderstood as evidence either of ignorance regarding the specificities of various aesthetic media or, on the other hand, of mere ignorance regarding conventions of formal creation within the traditional genres. Instead, the specificities of each medium become the object of an artistic production that confronts these conventions freely—-but not from a position of simple ignorance. This artistic production has rightly dismissed rigid definitions of genre-and, as Adorno was able to show, not by distancing itself from but, on the contrary, by intensifying the engagement of the specificities of the means of representation in question.  

This is also true—and here, I think, we should go beyond Adorno for the reflection on the potential of certain aesthetic means of representation from the perspective of a problem of another art traditionally alien to these means; for the confrontation of different aesthetic media in new hybrid genres or the many artistic variations on the notion, in McLuhanian terms, that the “content" of a newer medium is always an older one.67 Interestingly, the latter can be demonstrated particularly well in ways artists who appropriate today's only real “convergence medium"—-that of digitality. The fact that digitization makes virtually anything possible has led to novel hybrids such as time-based paintings, located somewhere between painting and film. Yet these unfold their aesthetic potential not by going beyond or by breaking with the genre-specific traditions but only by engaging them. The reflection and focus on that which is "'unique and proper" in each art. and the engagement of its other, as I will later show (see 2.3). are two sides of the same coin.  

Adormo himself seems to gesture toward this nexus when he writes that the boundaries between the \*immanent relation of one medium to the other and a syncretistic combination in the style of Scriabin's Prometheus" (RMP. 74) may well become blurry for some observers as the historical distance grows longer. Yet it would be entirely wrong to infer from this remark that Adorno means to relativize the difference between "immanent relation” and “syncretistic combination." This distinction--—-difficult as it may sometimes be to make--is absolutely crucial to Adorno. Yet the stipulation that the fraying of the boundaries between the genres is legitimate only when it is inherently motivated by an engagement of the specific problems of one particular art is clearly indispensable to Adorno not because he seeks to preserve the genres of art as such--which is Greenberg's and Fried's motivation--but because the historical fact of their differentiation, as the point of departure, is irrevocable. Some of the argumentative strands discussed above converge once more in this claim.  

It is based, on the one hand, on the assumption that the historical differentiation of the arts according to their media and the principle of the division of labor in bourgeois society are internally interrelated. Against the backdrop of this assumption, developed in his philosophy of history, Adorno rejects the unification of various aesthetic mediafor example, in Wagnerian music-drama as the semblance of a unity that is false in relation to the realities of bourgeois society. A fraying of the genres, on the other hand, motivated from within the individual arts acknowledges the irrevocability of their differentiation and, at the same time, of an unreconciled reality. Only this enables Adorno to incorporate this movement into his theory of autonomous art conceived as a theory of progress, which, as we have seen, is based on the idea of a mutual referential interrelation of unreconciled reality. art, and utopia. The reader may of course reject this argument from Adorno's philosophy of history in its entirety on systematic grounds  

I will come back to this issue shortly (see 2.3.3). But a simple empirical objection may also be raised at this point: many of the artists working today in hybrid intermedial forms do not at all aim to produce a unified total impression; on the contrary, they are interested in emphasizing the differences between the various media in their works. Yet this point would hardly satisfy Adorno. For his critique of the false unification of the arts, a critique inspired by the ideology of unity in the gesamtkunstwerk, is merely one aspect of Adorno's claim that transgressions of the boundaries between genres is legitimate only when their motivation is immanent to one particular art and driven by an engagement of the specific problems of this art.  

For, on the other hand, this latter claim aims at an emphatic idea   
of being true to the material for which specialization in one aesthetic   
medium would be the minimal requirement given even only the in  
lomogeneity of the aesthetic media that has emerged over the course   
f their history. "It is enough to remind ourselves,” writes Adorno, that historically, at least, one essential difference among the arts has distinguished between, on the one hand, those that are or were based on images and continue to feed on that tradition, that is to say, the imitative or representational arts, and on the other hand, those, like music, that, at least initially, were without images and had them grafted on only gradually, intermittently, and always precariously. There is a further qualitative distinction between literature, which depends upon concepts and cannot dispense with them entirely, even in its most radical form, and the nonconceptual forms of art. [...| Differences like these have their own profound implications. but at all events they demonstrate that the so-called arts do not form a continuum that would allow us to provide the entire complex of phenomena with a single unifying label.(AaA,382)  

Correspondingly, the critique of the compulsory unification of the arts in the gesamtkunstwerk—-if we recall Adorno's comments on Wagner's music-drama---is not confined to its context in the philosophy of history discussed above. Adorno criticizes the unification project of the gesamtkunstwerk rather because it is programmatically indifferent to the differences between the various aesthetic media.  

The fact, however, that the integration of the different aesthetic media into a single total impression usually goes awry--even in productions characterized by the gesamtkunstwerk and its ideology-—is to Adorno's mind merely an index of its failure, a failure without aesthetic valueof itsown.68  

Still, there are systematic reasons for the rigor of Adorno’s apodictic judgment of such productions. For, as Adorno conceives it, construction-—thorough compositional organization—-is of constitutive importance for aesthetic autonomy. The problem of the construction of aesthetic coherence is for him the central problem of any serious artistic production——-that is, one that aims to be true to the material. Even the stipulation that the negation of aesthetic synthesis should become the principle of formal creation is ultimately subordinate to that synthesis. That is why the problem of the construction of aesthetic coherence must neither be abstractly negated--as in aleatory works such as those of Cage\*—-nor, on the other hand, be forced when the medial conditions by themselves already contradict the idea of aesthetic coherence, as in the gesamtkunstwerk. Adorno's critique of the ideology of unity in the gesamtkunstwerk is thus simultaneously a critique of the lack of unity in its actual construction. Specialization in one aesthetic medium and the commitment it entails to a critical continuation of the genre-specific tradition are to Adorno's mind no less indispensable a prerequisite for the production of great art than fidelity, demonstrated by critical engagement, to the principle of aesthetic coherence. Both in his defense of specific artistic skills against the hybridization of aesthetic media and their respective problems, and in his defense of the principle of artistic construction against the principle of literalness, Adorno's argument comes so close to the aesthetic conservatism of Greenberg and Fried as to become nearly indistinguishable from it. Accordingly, Adorno, like Greenberg and Fried, writes, "art exists only in the arts" (AaA, 383).  

Of course, one cannot object to traditional artistic skills or the critical awareness of the history of their use, even for those hybrid intermedia productions that Adorno must exclude due to the systemic requirements of his theory of progress. The decisive question, however--and Duchamp usually stands as representative of this provocation--is whether the possibility of great art need still be tied at all to the skillful employment of the traditional aesthetic media, as Adorno, like Greenberg and Fried, insists. In fact, the trend toward the transgression of boundaries between genres is matched by an increasing individualization of the work of art in modernism that ultimately releases it from all ties to traditional aesthetic media, an individualization to which the philosophy of art generally responded and the beginnings of this response appear in fact quite early7—-in claiming that to go beyond the traditional theory of genres means to go back behind it: to turn to the general concept of art, on which any systematic attempt to categorize the variety of its manifold concrete realizationsmust be based.  

Up to this point, I myself have argued that we should conceive aesthetic autonomy as the effect of a specifically aesthetic object relation and no longer as a category that could be recovered by an aesthetics of production or the work. Our discussion must now turn to the consequences that a concept of art that is, in this sense, "generic" has, among other things, for the assessment of intermedial art. I will address this question once again by engaging Adorno's attempt to define the autonomy of art within a theory of progress. Still, it should already be clear that Adorno, by conceiving aesthetic autonomy from within a theory of progress, can hardly be made into an apologist for the explosive growth of new intermedial artistic genres. If we wish to defend the aesthetic potential of these intermedial procedures, which are currently omnipresent in the art world, we must obviously do so by distancing ourselves from, rather than drawing on,Adorno.  

# 2.2. . 3. Progress and Autonomy  

Indeed, with Adorno, the helplessness of the attempts to seal off an area proper to aesthetics against an outside of empirical reality could be criticized. These attempts have no other recourse than the conservative appeal to conventions from which art has sought to break free since the sixties. "Art.,\* according to Adorno's defense of this struggle. \*"needs something heterogeneous in order to become art. In the absence of that. the process that every work of art is lacks a target and so just freewheels. The clash between the work of art and the world of objects becomes productive, and the work authentic, only where this clash is allowed to happen and to objectify itself by its friction with the thing it devours" (AaA, 375). But Adorno cannot have the final say here with this defense of the disintegration of the boundaries between the arts: not because it has been shown that this defense in the end excludes a large part of the intermedial art seen today—-not, that is to say, because of its repressive consequencesbut rather for systematic reasons.  

For the "clash with the world of objects,” on which Adorno, like Fried, stakes his concept of aesthetic autonomy, cannot, as we have argued (2.2.1). be objectified in a theory of progress. Even those productions of modern art that are most sensitive to their materials and most conflicted in themselves are, for systematic reasons, incapable of achieving what for Adorno could alone constitute them as autonomous- that is, if they kept the two poles of the "aesthetic spirit, form and content, together. The receiving subject always already steps between the two. Yet the dialectical connection between the two sides of the “aesthetic spirit is evident only from the perspective of a philosophy that presupposes this dialectics for all art interpreting it in the context of a further thesis on the mutual interrelation of reality, art, and utopia. This means reading the works in accordance with a previously established hermeneutic schema and, consequently, reducing the experience of any concrete work to a mere recognition of contents already familiar from the philosophy ofhistory.  

The ending of "Art and the Arts," too, gives-—-with particular pathostestimony to this perspective on art from the philosophy of history. Adornowrites:  

While the present situation no longer has room for art--that was the meaning of the statement about the impossibility of poems after Auschwitz—-it nevertheless has need of it. For reality without images is the counterpart of another condition without images: the condition in which art disappears because the utopia encoded in every work of art has been fulfilled. In itself art is not capable of such a demise. This is why the arts eat away at each other. (AaA,387)  

What is problematic here is not only that the tendencies toward a fraying of the boundaries between genres are supposed to be, in toto, nothing but an illustration of the presumed constellation of unreconciled reality, art, and utopia——there is another problem hidden in the construction of this constellation itself. For the despair itself a reference to this constellation-as articulated in the final paragraph of "Art and the Arts,”' seems to be not only nourished by the bitter experience with the German past but also driven by conceptual motivations. As Albrecht Wellmer has correctly pointed out, it is "built into" the polemical interrelation in which Adorno believed he had to conceive art and reality.7 Because Adorno obviously associates the sphere of conceptual thinking as a whole with instrumental reason, he can consistently imagine mimesis only as the other of conceptual thinking. A convening of mimesis and rationality in art can, for the same reasons, only be thought of as a negation of historical reality. Utopia, removed from its original, political, place and, as it were, put into storage in art, can thus for purely conceptual reasons not be of this world—the world for its part, having been assigned tonegativity.  

Apart from the fact that Adorno thus generally blocks any perspective on the possibility of changing our reality by means of the communicative and intersubjective aspects of conceptual thinking,72 art becomes fixed in a position vis-a-vis this reality that is as polemical as it is otherworldly and utopian. Assigning this position to it, however, means not only overburdening it with content from the philosophy of history-—-it also means underestimating the critical and, under the right circumstances, even utopian potential of concrete works. For the particular works of art are by no means reducible to illustrations of the general referential historico-philosophical interrelation Adorno believes he must recognize time and again in the works of modern art he discusses (which, not incidentally, he chose to be as nonrepresentational as possible). Instead, the concrete work of art delineates an open horizon of possible formations of relation and meaning for the receiving subject; a horizon that may in each case, and in ever different ways, be sated with concrete sociopolitical content. In fact, this is true almost without exception for today's most important works (see 3.2). Yet what is specifically at stake in them can hardly be understood from Adorno's perspective. Adorno's philosophy-—-which addresses all philosophies-—-proves too general with regard to what is particular in the individual works. Against Adorno's own intentions, his historicophilosophical fixation on the referential interrelation between reality, art, and utopia in the end systematically misses the concrete semantic horizons of each work. The same goes for the progress-theoretical thesis of the dialectical unity of form and content, a unity that is to be the concrete production-aesthetic realization of this relation: it is a matter exclusively of questions of formal creation that are as such charged with historico-philosophical content.  

But what Adorno thus fails to do justice to is not merely the particular in each concrete work, including its respective semantic horizon, but also the particularity of art as such. For Adorno's progress-theoretical formalism (although it is an, as it were, second-order formalism, given its historico-philosophical codedness) corresponds——as does the more simplistic media-aesthetic formalism proposed by his American colleagues-—-to an ultimately technical concept of aesthetic autonomy that in my view cannot sufficiently account for what, certainly in Adorno, it is primarily intended to represent: the incommensurability of the work of art, its autonomy in relation to the subject and its reason. This concept stipulates the technical objectification of what, according to Adorno's own conception, must be precisely irreducible to technique. It determines in advance how—-in which way—-art must progressively escape the various ways in which it is determined. I think that this very operation, something almost like a category mistake, renders Adorno unable to remain true to his fundamental intuition that there is something elusive about art, an enigma. “Technique," he writes in Aesthetic Theory, "is the definable figure of the enigma in artworks."73 With his theory of progress, he has, as it were, always already solved this enigma-—and in so doing made it disappear.  

By contrast, I have offered a concept of aesthetic autonomy grounded in a theory of experience that makes the insolubility of the enigma of art the decisive point of its definition. The aesthetic phenomenon has the “structure of ungraspability,” says Rudiger Bubner in the central essay of his book Asthetische Erfahrung.74 The aesthetic object is essentially undefined; its constitution blocks any approach that attempts to lead to a conclusive understanding of it. "No name gets to the heart of it. \*7s The fact that the object incites understanding as much as it can ultimately shrug off any concrete hermeneutic act in a particularly noncommittal way only to provoke new ones is-as we have said-where the autonomy of art lies, its “clash with the world of objects." The aesthetic object becomes aesthetic by virtue not of particular qualities but of a specific sort of processual relation to it. Aesthetic autonomy, according to this proposed conceptualizationand Kant had already seen this--is not something that can be localized in particular object qualities. Works of art are “authentically" aesthetic, to use Adorno's term, not when they are formally constituted in a certain way but when they allow a particular, specifically aesthetic experience.  

Now the objection raised by a theory of experience to the conceptions of aesthetic autonomy offered by media aesthetics or a theory of progress is by no means tantamount, as might perhaps be feared, to a return to subjectivism that would sacrifice the art critical discourse and with it any consideration of questions of production aesthetics. Rather, this discourse, together with the criteria of its production-aesthetic judgment, moves to another systematic position. It is no longer a prerequisite of the aesthetic experience; instead, this discourse necessarily follows aesthetic experience. The objectivist misconception was to envision an object of critical assessment with constitutive qualities that precede the experience of this object; what is judged now is instead the object as an objective reflection of an experience prompted by it.7 But art critical discourse also necessarily follows aesthetic experience, lest the term "aesthetic object' become rmeaningless. If it is correct that aesthetic objects become aesthetic in the sense of a "second-order thing" only in and through the processuality of aesthetic experience, only in and through the processuality of a specific aesthetic object relation, then this also implies that aesthetic objects. because of this processuality, depend on forms of a public aesthetic discourse in which this process, as Adorno puts it in a passage already cited from his Aesthetic Theory, "crystallizes."77 Only in these forms, only in aesthetic discourse, can aesthetic objects show their \*second-order objecthood,” can they show themselves as aesthetic objects. Because these objects cannot be objectified as aesthetic—— as separate from the historically changing experience they provokepublic aesthetic discourse, in which this ever-changing experience becomes explicit, is also not merely accidental to the aesthetic objects but, at any moment in their history, constitutive of them.78  

Accordingly, autonomy as conceptualized in a theory of experience is also neither a transhistorical value (as in Fried) nor a value objectively situated in history (as in Adorno). If it is correct that the autonomy of a work is not tied to particular qualities of the object, then it is wrong to short-circuit the incommensurability of a work with technical innovation, as Adorno's theory of aesthetic progress suggests. His theory is obviously motivated by the conviction that artistic strategies without progress are inevitably afflicted by a loss of tension that declasses their once autonomous production to the status of mere decoration. In other words, any given artistic strategy that had been developed against a loss of tension in an earlier strategy will suffer the same loss in turn. This notion would almost seem to be based on the view held by a vitalistic view that mere duration will lead to the death of all living things and the reification of all movement into mere repetition; as a consequence, innovation becomes a goaleven more, a necessity—-for aesthetic production. This is not to suggest that Adorno elevates novelty as such to the status of an aesthetic category; he specifies the developmental logic of the arts by virtue of a theory of progress. But Adorno's progress-theoretical concept of autonomy, and this is the point here, reduces the historicity of the individual work to an evolutionary history of artistic forms in which the latter play their historically specific and at the same time inevitably limited role. Yet as even a superficial examination of the history of the reception of any randomly chosen work—marked as it may be by times of strong public recognition, but also by losses of tension, periods of latency, and renaissances--will show, the historical life of a work is irreducible to whatever role one particular formalist history of progress may assign to it. Adorno's correct insight into the historicity of aesthetic autonomy needs to be liberated from the association with his progress-theoretical objectivism and opened up toward the historical dimension of experience. Not the mere passage of time but only the experiences it occasions determine whether, but also how lastingly, works may lose their tension. For historically changeable experience also implies that the innovative potential implicit in a work is subject to ongoing reassessment.79 Accordingly, categories such as novelty or progress cannot be definitively pinned down on particular factual aspects. Instead, the question of whetherand, if so, in what respect—a work can be called progressive or, inversely, reactionary, is subject to ongoing and indefinite debate within the aesthetic discourse that is the public manifestation of experiences of art. This has in fact been powerfully demonstrated by the reactions to Adorno's own progress-theoretically motivated judgments of aesthetic value.  

So it seems by no means clear, even within the medial horizons demarcated by the traditional arts, how we can actually determine the state of aesthetic material, a state on which the identifiability of aesthetic progress in Adorno is dependent. Which aspects qualify as state of the art at any given point in time is probably not immediately evident even to Adorno's most committed disciples. But this problem, and with it that of determining aesthetic progress, becomes dramatically important in the moment we no longer internalize Adorno's formalist-philosophical perspective on the production of art. This already becomes evident with respect to the normative debates over Adorno's perhaps most well-known aesthetic judgment, according to which Schoenberg is considered progressive while Stravinsky is considered reactionary (because Schoenberg can be inscribed in the history of aesthetic progress Adorno wants to tell whereas Stravinsky cannot be).8 For the respective debates demonstrated that, contrary to Adorno, other conceptions of aesthetic progress can be justified as well. The argument over Adorno's critique of realism similarly showed that other positions on the question of aesthetic progress could be held.81 \*"Precisely the criterion,” as Christoph Menke wrote in view of these discussions, \*"that is supposed to establish evaluations in unambiguous fashion multiplies in number and lets the question of evaluation reappear on a second level: Which sort of aesthetic progress do we or should we want?"s2 Now the finding that the category of aesthetic progress, if it is not misconceived in reductionist fashion, is inevitably contestable does not imply that it should be neglected by art criticism. Because art criticism treats objects of art and not those of nature, it necessarily relates to their having been made. And this relation also, and not least importantly, probably involves a reflection on how advanced the artistic construction in question is--even when such construction can no longer be associated with traditional artistic skills. In this sense, the central position the concept of progress occupies in Adorno is surely symptomatic of its role in art critical discourse. But we must object to Adorno's attempt to ground his definition of aesthetic progress in a philosophy of history--the definition of this term is an ever-recurrent problem of art critical judgment, and not already its solution. On the other hand, my pointing out that the category of progress is contested should not be misconstrued as advocating a live-and-let-live attitude toward the divergences between critical positions, favoring, for example, the notion that, given the uncertainty surrounding the foundations of aesthetic judgment, anything goes, as many would have it. The fact that criteria of aesthetic judgment can never be established once and for all means, rather, that only the public debate over such criteria can lend them a degree of generality and bindingness.  

The aesthetic judgment that $^{\circ\circ}\mathrm{x}$ is beautiful,” which has been used in philosophical tradition since Kant to distinguish the structure of aesthetic experience, is not identical with the judgment that $^{\circ\circ}\mathrm{x}$ is good'": the judgment that $^{66}\mathrm{x}$ is beautiful is the value judgment implied by an aesthetically experienced object relation; this implied value judgment, then, is a merely necessary but not sufficient condition for the art critical judgment that ${}^{\circ}\mathbf{x}$ is good." Accordingly, aesthetic discourse—-the public dispute over the quality of individual worksshould not simply be misconstrued, as I may have seemed to suggest until now, as the conceptual substantiation of a value judgment already anticipated in aesthetic experience. The validity of interpretation and aesthetic judgment is indeed in this sense dependent on the experience that necessarily precedes them. And aesthetic experience in turn indeed anticipates its objectification in public aesthetic discourse. This intrinsic anticipation of art critical judgment distinguishes aesthetic experience (Erfahrung) from mere subjective experience (Erlebnis). Conversely. interpretation and criticism are not mere external additions to the totality of aesthetic experience but are already constitutive elements of this totality.83 Still, the subsequent explication of this totality of experience does not simply coincide with it. The subsequent discursive explication of the totality of an aesthetic experience will in fact frequently also be an important corrective to its implicit normativity. "The interpretive retracing of the specific contents of a totality of aesthetic experience can contribute to an indirect test of the direct experience of the fact of its stringency, Menke writes. "because it describes aesthetic totalities in such a way that, against the backdrop of our previous aesthetic experiences, judgments [regarding their stringency] appear more or less plausible .\*84  

And of course such subsequent interpretations of a totality of aesthetic experience can themselves be contested in the public aesthetic discourse they address. My own engagement of Fried's art critical interpretation of his experience of Minimalist art above (in 1.2.1) is only one possible example of such a debate. Ultimately, the same holds for the dispute over the correct conception of aesthetic autonomy, which was the fundamental issue in this engagement. The fact that my conception of aesthetic autonomy——-which I have in the preceding pages not only described but also explained and defended by engaging the arguments of Cavell. Fried, Greenberg, Krauss, Luhmann, and Adorno-is itself normative is not a valid objection to it. To the contrary, the fact that my conception of aesthetic autonomy both corresponds with and explicitly disputes other theories that assign a similar or different role to art only points out what has always been the task of philosophical aesthetics: as Martin Seel has put it succinctly, "to be an apology of aesthetic practice based on an understanding of its best possibilities."s Where apologies are necessary, however, it can obviously also be disagreed upon as to what can be considered the best possibility of aesthetic praxis.  

If I have once again felt the need to offer a general argument based on a theory of experience that, for the time being, has only marginally concerned itself with the specifics of intermedial installation art, this was above all because I needed to respond to art theoretical and philosophical preconceptions whose, as it were, a priori conceptual terms block the aesthetic potential of intermedial procedures-be it that they reject these procedures as such based on their media-aesthetic premises, be it that they impose unacceptable restrictions upon their possibilities based on a theory of progress. But to say the latter is to say that this engagement of other theories proceeded in implicit anticipation of a different interpretation of this artistic praxis and the experience of it. But before explaining this different interpretation by drawing on a number of features of installation art in the next chapter (2.3), I would like to point out an important consequence of my attempt to cut the ties binding the concept of aesthetic autonomy to the objectivist attempts to define it according to an aesthetics of production. This consequence once more concerns the problem of the relation between the specific and the generic we had begun with.  

It is obvious that a productive and critical reflection on the traditional aesthetic media is by no means the sole focus of artistic production today. The work of one artist can encompass underpants sewn together as well as found film posters and a serious examination of the possibilities of painting, in light of a situation in which all this is possible-such is the case, for example, with the contemporary artist Michael Krebber.86 This is what is at stake in the debate prompted by what de Duve calls the “historical, critical, \*theoretical′ and in the end ethical’ challenge of an artistic production that has become potentially “generic” after Duchamp.87 And de Duve is correct also in asserting that this situation--that potentially anything can become art—is a challenge faced with particular urgency by the visual arts. For they have indeed been emancipated, at least in principle, from the traditions of painting and sculpture.88 The aesthetic medium seems less than ever to be capable of guaranteeing a work's success; and the standards for aesthetic progress have multiplied radically. But this does not primarily signal to us--or that is how I understand de Duve's post-Kantian problematization of the relation between the "generic" and the “specifie"—-an ethical problem in the sense of a general concept of art having been asserted at the cost of particularity. On the contrary, in light of very heterogeneous and, hence, specific productions, this general concept is inevitably alwaysatstake.  

Today's avant-garde art, Alexander Garcia Duttmann says, is avant-garde no longer "in the sense of the so-called historical avantgarde, but in the sense of touching upon a limit, upon an end that is always [...] the end of art itself.\*89 Precisely because art must face the "conditions of radical, that is, of constitutive contingency” today as never before.\* the haunting question of its raison d'etre simultaneously points to its dependence on aesthetic judgment. For the aesthetic object as aesthetic object depends on judgment that confers on it the general status of "art." Inversely, however, there can be no aesthetic judgment without reference to a particular aesthetic object. The fact that in what Adormo critically called the “nominalist situation” this reference can no longer be guided by the traditional criteria would therefore amount neither to a surrender of the particular to the general nor on the other hand to the end of criticism. For if the reflection on the specific qualities of each aesthetic medium is capable neither of constituting clearly defined artistic genres nor of safeguarding, by itself, the autonomy of art-—-and if even the criterion of progress cannot solve the problem of our critical assessments but is instead itself part of that problem—that only indicates the critical challenge posed by the attempt to judge works of art as art. For this attempt challenges us also to work on the critical categories themselves, which the endgames of art time and again unsettle and set in motion.  

That taking up this challenge is worthwhile also to philosophical aesthetics is something we can perhaps still learn best from Adorno. For Adorno always conceived the particular in contemporary art as a “force [field]," as a corrective and an inspiration to the  

generality of aesthetic concepts.? The incompatibility of modern art with the categories of traditional aesthetics thus compelled Adorno to rethink these categories with the aspiration to reveal their “transformed truth."92 The present book is driven by a similar motivationnow with a view to the phenomenon of contemporary installation art that is increasingly incompatible with Adorno's categories. For to defend contemporary installation art as art means, as we have seen, to transform the concept of art, of aesthetic autonoiny, with the ambition, again, to arrive at a better and more correct understanding of these concepts. The concept of aesthetic autonomy I derive from the particular focus on contemporary artistic production aspires to general validity beyond the confines of contemporary installation art; if this claim to general validity remains ultimately debatable, this marks the fact that aesthetic theory, too, is fallible. The fact that a theory is aware of and reflects on the fallibility inevitably entailed by its fundamental openness to artistic developments is not a weakness but, I think, on the contrary, one of the methodological strengths of an aesthetic theory conceived as a critical project.  

The attempt undertaken here to critically continue the aesthetic project of modernism--even and especially in light of contemporary artistic phenomena—-instead of replacing it with a general theory of culture or with aisthetics 9 sharply contrasts with those theoretical endeavors that draw on Adorno, but at the same avoid the category of aesthetic autonomy altogether merely because Adorno's modernist conception of it is obviously no longer adequate to a large portion of the most widely discussed productions of contemporary art.94 Indeed, the art of the past thirty to forty years has largely refused any guidance from the categories of modernist discourse: its forms are intermedially hybrid, are found ready-made, industrially manufactured, calculated using a random generator, or assembled out of citations from previous works. And after 1970, modernist discourse indeed fell into a crisis So deep that even its embittered diagnoses of decline can hardly conceal the inadequacy of its arguments to contemporary phenomena. For, as is well known. such crises imply that the time has come for a paradigm shift.\*s Accordingly, the arrival of a new paradigm has more than once been proclaimed in art critical debates over aesthetic postmodernism. The question we are concerned with, however, is how exactly the new paradigm should be spelled out, particularly concerning its relation to the old paradigm as well as the interpretation of the phenomena both attempt to achieve.  

Following a respective shift in philosophical aesthetics, I propose to replace the modernist paradigm with one based on a theory of experience, as the latter is better able to do justice to both the fundamental critical intuitions of its predecessor and to contemporary. phenomena. Whereas the negative stereotype of aesthetic postmodernism simply equates artistic opposition to modernist categories with an abstract negation of aesthetic autonomy, an engagement of the modernist discourse from the perspective of a theory of experience shows that art after 1970 attacks not the idea of autonomous art as such but only its objectivist misconception. I think, therefore, that the dissolution of the aesthetic categories that govern modernist discourse a motivated and concrete dissolution performed by intermedial and installation procedures--represents a piece of aesthetic enlightenment: progress, if you will. But this would also mean progress over the modernist paradigm of progress; over the objectivism of the notion of autonomy founded in a theory of progress as well as over the objectivist explanation of the historicity of art that goes along with it. If, then, we wish to speak of postmodern phenomena in reference to art after 1970, the notion of postmodernism would mean an impulse from within the modernist project to break free of rigid modernist conventions, not a break with that project; an impulse toward its selftranscendence, not a departure from it.  

Certain features of intermedial installation art seem to me particularly significant for such an impulse, as I will elaborate in the next chapter. Not only do they illustrate that intermedial procedures do not abandon the reflection on aesthetic media but in fact radicalize it by liberating it from genre-specific limitations. This holds true both in those cases where this reflection proceeds from the logic of the avantgarde engagement of the various individual arts (cinematographic and sound installation) and in those cases where it is based on the hybrid attempt at fusing two arts (theatrical installation). The strategies of intermedial installation art further demonstrateand this point is of particular systematic importance--that the transgression of the traditional boundaries between the genres is motivated by an implicit resistance to an objectivist concept of art and of the experience of it. Indeed, it is motivated by the ambition to break free from this concept—not only do intermedial strategies refuse guidance from the modernist discourse, by the same token, they expressly emphasize a structural aspect of aesthetic experience that is as fundamental to its autonomy as it is obscured or marginalized in modernist conceptions of art, namely, that of the indefiniteness of this experience. This is the case not only for intermedial installation art, but the latter makes it particularly evident. Our examination of Michael Fried's argument already showed that installation art in space, following Minimal art, undermines the objectivist ideal of the instantaneous comprehensibility of art. The following chapter will show, complementarily, that those forms of installation art that engage in a revision or integration of time-based arts work specifically against the objectivist ideal of a synchronous mental reconstruction of the work. If this places the art of installation once again in opposition to central features of modernist art discourse, as the second step of my engagement of Cavell's theory of theater and Adorno's philosophy of music will show, that is a sign—-according to the normative consequences of the reflections that I would like to open for discussion--not of an aesthetic decline but, on the contrary, of quality.  

# (G. E. Lessing, Jacques Derrida)  

In the broadest sense, the art of installation is obviously an art form that has to do with space. Installations are spatial art in a quite literal sense: they organize the exhibition space at hand. This not only distinguishes them from two-dimensional painting- which serves as G. E. Lessing's model for the concept of spatial art9%--but also from the spatial extension of sculpture. I will return to the specific question of whether the art of installation can also shed light on traditional spatial arts in the next part. In the meantime, the present chapter will address the relations that installational spatial art maintains to time-based arts that it intermedially assimilates and works with: theater, film, video, and music.  

In this context, it is of course worth noting that Lessing conceived the notions of spatial art and time-based art as opposites. This is precisely why the notion of spatial art was originally conceived in reference not to the three-dimensional extension of the plastic arts but-—-in contradistinction to the consecutive quality of the elements of poetry--to the juxtaposition of the elements on the painting's surface: their simultaneity. Accordingly, Lessing also contemplated the object that gave the title to his famous treatise on the boundaries between the arts, the late Hellenistic Laocoon group, as though it were not a sculpture but a painted panel. Yet because Lessing also recognizes that there can be no simultaneity without time, his Laocoon, known for its rigid division of the arts according to their spatial or temporal dimensions, is a suitable reminder at the beginning of our examination of these questions of the particular way in which temporality is constitutive of all spatial arts.97  

For the spatial art of painting, according to Lessing, is only successful when absolute simultaneity transcends itself, in its effect, into time—when what is represented in spatial juxtaposition  

appears as a development of action or plot that, as it were, is holding its breath. Lessing's theorem of the “pregnant moment,”" too, aims at this point. In order to narrate a story, the painter—as opposed to the poet—has only a single moment at his disposal: the moment he will record on the canvas,9 which he can therefore never choose carefully enough, as Lessing says, particularly when the painting in question is meant to "stand the test not only of a passing glance, but of long and repeated contemplation."9 A pregnant moment is one which "allows the imagination free scope." "The longer we gaze,”" writes Lessing, "the more must our imagination add; and the more our imagination adds, the more we must believe we see."100 In Lessing, then—unlike in Diderot, whom Lessing translated-the pregnant moment does not function like a hieroglyph from which one can read at a single glance the past, present, and future of what is represented; that is, its historical or narrative meaning.101 Rather, Lessing's pregnant moment is pregnant because it contains a representational potential that can be brought to life only by the play of the imagination.1o2 Of course, even Lessing restricts this play of the imagination, in an aesthetics of content, to the imagination of the plot development the represented moment is meant to evoke. But as Inka Mulder-Bach has shown contra to David E. Wellbery's interpretation of Laocoon, the point is by no means that the painting is to sublate itself in the pregnant moment “as material painting” in order to gesture toward \*"the area of the free scope of imaginationto the area of the narrative, of poetry."i03 It is, rather, that the powers of imagination, aroused by the pregnant moment, are to enter into a process with the painting that cannot be brought to a halt either in what is \*'materially" seen or in a single comprehensive projection of narrative meaning.104 In this sense, however, the notion of the pregnant moment structurally exceeds any mere aesthetics of content. It aims not only at the imaginative bringing-to-life of what is represented but simultaneously also at a bringing-to-life of the representation itself. \*"The naive comment that when looked at intensely a painting. the flesh of a Rubens nude comes alive," Adorno illustrates the issue in a different context, \*"connotes more than that one thinks the woman represented there is alive. This will hardly be the case, and certainly not where significant paintings are concerned. What is alive is rather the paintings themselves, what is painted, not what has been painted" (RMP, 70-1).  

Against the backdrop of what we have said so far about the structure of aesthetic experience, we should add here that the life of the representation is not reducible to the imaginative bringing-tolife of what it represents. For the imaginative bringing-to-life of what is represented is only one side of that play of processes in which the imagination gets entangled in gazing at the representation. For, on the other side, the representation constitutively eludes, time and again, the totalities of meaning it provokes. This is, in fact, what sets it into aesthetic motion. Lessing himself seems to hint at this specifically aesthetic becoming-enigmatic of seeing-as when he writes: "The more our imagination adds, the more we must believe we see."1os The production of meaning at, or rather in, the work of art, which is how I have so far explained the becoming-enigmatic of the aesthetic object in experience, necessarily proves, precisely where it yields illusionistic effects of life, to be a projection, a case of "'something dependent that has become independent"106——-as semblance, referring the viewer back to the materiality of the work of art. But the latter is never a simple and evident given either. For this materiality now proves to be “pregnant" with representational potential of its own, inciting new formations of meaning, and so on. Incidentally, the structural indefiniteness of this specifically aesthetic process in which seeing and imagination both heighten and contest one another is not the least reason behind Lessing's stipuiation that the work of art be suitable for “long and repeated contemplation."107  

These reflections, however, further imply that not all elements of a work can ever be equally and simultaneously present to the viewer. Even in the case of a structurally very simple painting, the notion of an absolute simultaneous givenness of its elements would be a "theological" idea, as Derrida would put it.108 Instead, the individual elements are constituted as such-—-that is, in their significance, only in a potentially infinite process of reference, in the process of entering and passing over into ever new sets of interrelations, in a dynamic that is the work of art and whose internal structure is temporal. There are certainly limits to how much of this can be read into Lessing. But it remains interesting that already in Lessing, even the ideally "simultaneous” spatial art of painting bears an index of temporality, mediated by the productivity of the imagination, which alone can release the work of art into its processuality. If we understand this temporality in the way I propose, it should not be confused, and this is particularly important with respect to the three-dimensional spatial arts,109 with the time required to view the work of art as a whole—-if we think of the fact that this takes walking around a sculpture or through an installation. Neither, however, should it be identified with the historical or narrative meaning of what is represented. For the temporality that is in question here is related to the processual existence of the work of art itself, to the constitutive role of the fundamentally indefinite processes of aesthetic experience.  

But if this is the case for all art, the question of what the discovery of this specifically aesthetic temporality means with respect to the time-based arts arises. For this temporality, being potentially infinite, obviously does not coincide with the limited time in which a piece of music, a film, or a play takes place. Something similar seems to pertain in the case of literature, of which the time of the experience is obviously irreducible to the time of an act, conceived as linear, of reading. The point of departure for the following considerations is the diagnostic hypothesis that this very incongruity has itself become an important object of artistic production since the sixties. The tendency toward the so-called spatialization of time-based arts, that is, their intermedial approximation to the principles of the spatial arts, is not the least testimony to this work with and on the tension between the temporality in which the time-based arts unfold and the internal temporality of the experience of such work. The work on these tensions—-between the passing of time and the time of experience-not only motivates intermedial productions between literature, film, theater. and music on the one hand and visual arts on the other. As I will show, the procedures under consideration here are moreover marked by an implicit resistance to an objectivist concept of art and the experience of art. For the various strategies artists employ to distance their work from the traditional work of the time-based arts manifestly labor against the objectivist ideal that models this experience as a synchronous mental reconstruction of the work-and thus labor, once again, against a central motif of modernist discourse. Indeed, opposition to the metaphysical vestiges of this discourse, I would maintain, is one of the central motivations driving the spatialization of the time-based arts-—and, to the extent that the latter culminates in installation art, this opposition is also the backdrop against which the genuinely aesthetic intervention of installation art becomes visible.  

In order to arrive at a better understanding of this intervention, and because installation art in its various subgenres engages literature as well as flm, theater, and music, it would seem advisable that we first take stock of how, and to which degree, the so-called time-based arts themselves have moved toward the principles of spatial art. To this end, we need a more precise understanding of the tension-which is fundamental to works of art organized by timebetween the temporality of the work on the one hand, and that of its experience on the other. I will begin by turning to theater.  

# The Temporal Space of Landscape Theater  

In a short text that has exercised extraordinary influence in the world   
of avant-garde theater, Gertrude Stein accounts for why traditional   
theater makes her “nervous,” particularly with regard to its temporality: Your sensation as one in the audience in relation to the play played before you your sensation I say your emotion concerning that play is always either behind or ahead of the play at which you are looking and to which you are listening. So your emotion as a member of the audience is never going on the same time as the action of the play. [...]  

This that the thing seen and the thing felt about the thing seen not going on at the same tempo is what makes the being at the theatre something that makes anybody nervous. [...]  

And nervousness is the certain proof that the emotion of the one seeing and the emotion of the thing seen do not progress together.11o  

What that makes her nervous already begins, according to Stein, with the fact that a curtain separates the events on stage from the audience, and people sitting in front of you might block the view even further. All of this insistently reminds you, of course, that you are part of the audience and not part of the events on stage. The curtain and the other people in the audience are manifest signs of the ontological and therefore irresolvable separation between the events on stage and the space of the audience, which Stanley Cavell also took as the point of departure for his critique of theatricality in the theater. Yet while Cavell, as we have seen, attempted to resolve or cathartically reshuffle the problem with this structure via a theory of empathetic witnessing that stipulates that the spectator makes the time of the dramatic events his own."l it is precisely this operation that Stein finds impossible, for the time of the events on stage can never be completely synchronous-—- they can never be brought into complete accordance with the internal time of aesthetic experience."2 But because the empathic convergence of the "emotional time of the audience with the time of the events on stage is indeed the implicit aspiration of traditional dramatic theater --in this, Cavell is a theorist faithful to the theater of drama—-the audience, Stein claims, will inevitably become nervous. For an audience that aims at even only an approximate fulfillment of this idealistic aspiration must reckon with certain hurdles that structurally define the theatrical experience.  

There is. first, the doubling-marginalized by Cavell's theory of the theater. which privileges the model of drama-of all theatrical signs into what is representing and what is represented. Accordingly, the initial source of Stein's nervousness is the fact that the spectator in the theater, unlike the lone reader of Shakespeare's dramas, for example, is compelled to make the “acquaintance” not only of the characters but simultaneously always also of those who represent them. “When one reads a play,” Stein writes,  

and very often one does read a play, anyway one did read Shakespeare's play a great deal at least I did, it was always necessary to keep one's finger in the list of characters for at least the whole first act, and in a way it is necessary to do the same when the play is played. One has one's programme for that and beside one has to become or had become acquainted with the actors as an actor and one has one's programme too for that. And so the introduction to the characters on the stage has a great many different sides to it. And this has again a great deal to do with the nervousness of the theatre excitement. (P, xxxvi-ix)  

We might object that even the lone reader of Shakespeare's dramas has to make a double acquaintance: on the one hand with the drama's text and on the other with the dramatis personae represented in it. But the general double structure of aesthetic signs, which is what is at issue here, moves to the fore in a particularly glaring way in the theater. The double acquaintance of the figures on the stage, of the characters and the actors, and with it the doubling of all theatrical signs into what is representing and what is represented—produces a tension within the theatrical signs that is obviously incapable of resolution in favor of what is represented; the nervousness that results from this tension cannot be put to rest. Not even if the actor attempts to lose himself completely in his role. This tension is constitutive of both the structure of theater and its experience.  

A second cause of Stein's nervousness when attending the theater is that the spectator has to deal at each moment of the performance with the simultaneity of various visual and auditory theatrical signs, whose perception, as it were, stands in the way of any one-dimensional linear attention to the plot:  

I became fairly consciously troubled by the things over which one stumbles over which one stumbled to such an extent that the time of one's emotion in relation to the scene was always interrupted. The things over which one stumbled and there it was a matter both of seeing and hearing were clothes, voices, what they the actors said, how they were dressed and how that related itself to their moving around. Then the bother of never being able to begin over again because before it had commenced it was over, and at no time had you been ready, either to commence or to be over. (P, xli)   
The simultaneity of the various signs of theater, according to Stein,   
stands in a tense relation to the course of events on stage because   
the audience is constantly tempted to relate the different signs of   
theater to one another, to do justice to their simultaneity. In other   
words, the simultaneity of the various theatrical signs implies a mode   
of perception aiming at the theatrical tableau. With its various   
possible spatial constellations of interrelated individual elements, the   
tableau stands out from the course of the dramatic action, or, more   
generally, from the course of the theatrical performance, without,  

however, being capable of being grasped or recollected as such. The tension between the theatrical signs unfolding in juxtaposition with each other in space (the space of the performance) at every individual moment and the stage events taking place one after the other in the course of time cannot be sublated. The resulting nervousness cannot be put to rest, not even when the theatrical signs are put to the service of the dramatic action and hierarchically subordinated to language. This tension, too, is constitutive of the structure of the theater and of the experience of the theater.  

In Stein's experience, then-—-and we can generalize here --the theater of drama is "emotionally” overburdening in a double sense: first. due to the tension between what is representing and what is represented (a tension that is fundamental to all theatrical signs) and second, due to the tension between the spatial simultaneity of the various theatrical signs and the temporal course of the events on stage. But both structural elements of the theater overburden the spectator only when he attempts to obey the demands of traditional dramatic theater, that is to say, when he attempts to focus on the action represented to such a degree that the time of the staging converges with the internal temporality of the experience of that staging. Now, we can argue against this notion of an overburdening that it is based on a misapprehension of the theater as an aesthetic phenomenon. For to attempt to do justice to the dramatic action's demand for presentness means, as we objected to Cavell's claim, to efface an essential aspect of what makes the theater an aesthetic phenomenon: the double structure of aesthetic signs and—as we can now add—its fundamentally open referential context. If the engagement with Cavell and Fried showed, moreover, that the ethical necessity to overcome these structural moments is based on false premises, then there is no good reason why the theater should not in fact highlight them-instead of marginalizing them, as traditional dramatic theater does. This is precisely the issue that Stein's aesthetics of the theater brings into play. While Cavell proposes an ideal spectator who is in “emotional’ synchrony with the action represented on stage in order to transform the aesthetic phenomenon of the theater into an ethical one, Stein's discovery of her nervousness in the face of this overstraining demand leads her to a  

different, “post-dramatic" theater.  

Nervousness in the theater is not inevitable, says Stein. You only have to stop trying to narrate a dramatic plot, or indeed any story at all. "Everybody knows so many stories," Stein notes laconically, "and what is the use of telling another story" (P, xliv). Instead of telling yet another story, plays, according to Stein's famous counterproposal, ought to be more like landscapes:  

I felt that if a play was exactly like a landscape then there would be no difficulty about the emotion of the person looking on at the play being behind or ahead of the play because the landscape does not have to make acquaintance. You may have to make acquaintance with it, but it does not with you, it is there and so the play being written the relation between you at any time is so exactly that that it is of no importance unless you look at it. [...]  

The landscape has it formation and as after all a play has to have formation and be in relation one thing to the other thing and as the story is not the thing as any one is always telling something then the landscape not moving but being always in relation, the trees to the hills the hills to the fields the trees to each other any piece of it to any sky and then any detail to any other detail, the story is only of importance if you like to tell or hear a story but the relation is there anyway. And of that relation I wanted to make a play and I did, a great number of plays. (P, xlvi-xlviii)   
Primary among the relations Stein speaks of, however, is that of the   
individual elements of the theater text to one another--for Stein   
here refers to how she thinks the plays should be constructed. \*Stein's   
written text," Hans-Thies Lehmann writes, "in a way already is a   
landscape. To a previously unheard of extent it emancipates the clause   
from the sentence, the word from the clause, the phonetic from the   
semantic, and the sound from the cohesion of meaning."3 By becoming   
autonomous, divorced from dramatic or narrative function, the   
individual elements of the texts enter into a spatial rather than a tem  
poral interrelation. The organization of the text invites a reading   
that sets into motion a discontinuous play of crisscrossing formations  

of interrelation between its various elements. Still, even when typographical stylization, as in Mallarme's Un coup de des, highlights the spatial arrangement of a text on paper, the text--by stipulating the act of reading--refers toward its translation back into time.  

""Writing is timeless as an image of the temporal,? says Adorno (RMP, 70). This, by the way, is one of the senses in which the term \*"writing\* (and, complementarily, \*'reading") has come to be used widely in the discourse of visual art. It refers to the temporality of all spatial art, which is immanent to its dependence on interpretive processes. It comes as no surprise that this relation has not remained unexamined in the visual arts. Lawrence Weiner's wall texts, for instance, can be understood as a quite literal reflection on the spatial quality of literature, but also as an implicit reflection on the latent temporality of all spatial art. Not unlike visual art, Stein's textual landscape, and this would seem to be the decisive point, is temporal only in the sense of the processuality of the aesthetic experience itself that sets this landscape in motion—-and no longer in the sense of a temporal course of action represented in the text. So there is no more reason to be nervous,right?  

Now. the point of departure of Stein's reflections was not the situation of the solitary reader. For the latter always has the option of a discontinuous reading at his disposal, even if his text is a traditional drama. He has no difficulty relating the representation (the text, or rather its elements) back to what is represented (the plot) by going back and rereading such that no tension need arise with the anti-teleological internal time of his “emotions" (his interpretive process). In this sense, literature is never entirely reducible to the temporal sequence of its elements--it always also has a spatial quality in the sense that its elements also stand literally next to one another and can, at least in principle, be placed in arbitrary interrelation. Yet unlike traditional narrative literature, theater has to do not only with the representation of time 114 but always also with its organization. In this sense, theater, like flm and music, is a time-based art in the literalsense.  

It is thus not the reader who has to battle with Steinian nervousness but the theater audience. For unlike the reader, the audience in the theater is confronted with the real time of the dramatic event on stage. The latter, however, cannot be made to converge with the time of the spectator's experience, Stein explains, because the theatrical means of representation are obviously irreducible to their dramatic function. This is as true of the perception of the actors behind, next to, or in front of the characters they embody as it is of the perception of the various theatrical signs that appear in spatial interrelation with each other at every moment of the performance--a perception that exceeds the course of the action, anticipating it, lagging behind it, or more generally distracting from it. What is the significance of the transfer of Stein's poetics to the theater in light of this situation?  

" Just as in [Stein's] texts the representation of reality recedes in favour of the play of words,” Lehmann writes, "in a ‘Stein theatre’ there will be no drama, not even a story; it will not be possible to distinguish protagonists and even roles and identifiable characters will be missing."'l1s Moreover, Stein's aesthetic aims at a dehierarchization of the means of theatrical representation. Language as a theatrical means becomes the equal of the other theatrical signs such that the audience can produce interrelations between language, set, and the costumes and movements of the actors without their mutual crisscrossing contradicting the aspirations of the text, which can in this sense indeed be called post-dramatic. So there is no more reason to be nervous in the theater either, right?  

An initial answer might be "yes, there still is." For to the extent that landscape theater also remains theater and must be performed in time, its structural problems persist. On the one hand, the actors on stage still represent something even if they no longer have to embody identifiable roles. For theatrical signs are never a pure, “literal\*\* material but always already elements of a representational relation. Their relation to what they represent, their relation to their potential meaning, remains essential to them, even if they have no single determinable meaning (such as that of the dramatic plot). Still, landscape theater would seem to allay Stein's nervousness regarding the doubling of all theatrical signs into what is representing and what is represented—not, however, because landscape theater would negate the representational function of theatrical signs: but, on the contrary, because, liberated from their dramatic function, these signs can emerge in their multiplicity and pluridimensionality and be related to one another in aesthetic processes of understanding.  

On the other hand, however, the events on stage still take place in time. While Steinian theatrical action is not teleologically oriented toward the development of a plot, its elements --unlike the elements of a text or a painting--are still subject to change in time, however subtle it may be. This also implies that earlier theatrical images are no more retrievable in landscape theater than they were in dramatic theater. For this reason, too, landscape theater will not entirely do away with Steinian nervousness. Now, "time, by its very nature, cannot be forced into identity with space; [...] anything organized via temporal organization is not simultaneous, but successive [...] cannot be expressed otherwise than tautologically,” as Adorno already noted regarding the tendency toward spatialization in music (RMP, 69). Nor does Stein deny this condition; in fact, she reflects on it in the very term "landscape." For landscapes, as Martin Seel has pointed out, are not static. There is always movement in them: "at least [that] of the light, usually also of the air and plants, of animals and people as well as of the implements the latter operate. To perceive them is not only to experience the existence and transformation of many things in the space, it is to experience a space that is \*taking place.\*116 By transferring the principle of the landscape to theater, Stein thus by no means neglects the dimension of time.  

Unlike in dramatic theater, however, here, the focus is no longer on the represented time of a dramatic plot-—"Stein theatre” instead reflects time in the dimension of representation. Through subtle variations and repetitive loops, Stein's plays, "similar to the later  

'minimal music,117 seem to make no progress and yet undergo subtle change. “Anyway the play as I see it is exciting,” Stein writes, “and it moves but it also stays and that is as I said in the beginning might be what a play should do" (P, lii). The constellation of theatrical elements thus becomes potentially meaningful, not only in relation to earlier and later constellations, but also in terms of the timing of alterations to and repetitions of it. Of course, this is structurally already the case in dramatic theater. But the temporal organization of theatrical elements comes to the fore precisely as these elements are liberated from their function of representing time (for instance, the time of the dramatic action). If landscape theater thus reduces the Steinian nervousness in this respect as well, it is not because the time of representation, of the performance, is now finally and felicitously made to coincide with that of aesthetic experience, but rather because the time of theatrical representation comes to the fore in the dimension of representation and can be reflected as such in the potentially infinite and structurally anti-teleological temporality of aesthetic experience. Stein's landscape theater is thus altogether an exemplary instance of a theatrical aesthetic that has left behind the dominance of drama and with it also the objectivist ideal of an aesthetics of presentness, according to which the time of the performance should not only, by virtue of the viewer's empathetic concentration on the represented time of the dramatic action, be sublated in the latter, but also thereby be synchronized with the time of the viewer's experience.  

Unlike installations that integrate time-based arts like cinematographic or sound installations (see 2.3.3 and 2.3.4), the problematic of the space-time relation initially appears to be reversed in stage setting-like theatrical installations: if some developments in theater evince what can be called a tendency toward spatialization, then some theatrical installations conversely appear to tend toward temporalization. And it is in this context that the simple observation that the viewer of an installation needs time to walk through the installation gains special significance. I have pointed out several times that it would be a misconception to confuse this time with the anti-teleological and fundamentally indefinite time of aesthetic experience --only the latter is capable, as I have sketched above, of setting the elements of spatial art, static in themselves, in motion, of bringing them to life, and thus providing them with an index of temporality. If, however, we do not confuse the fundamentally indefinite time of the aesthetic experience with the finite time required to walk through an installation, then attention to the latter can lead us to an important aspect of a particular variety of installation art.  

This is demonstrated by comparison with the structural problems of the theater I have just discussed with reference to the “Stein theater': if Stein's landscape theater can exemplify the attempt to reduce the tension between the time of the staging and the time of aesthetic experience refectively, that is, by fundamentally acknowledging it, then we might conversely say that certain installations, whether intentionally or not, reflectively build up a tension between the time of walking through them and the time of aesthetic experience.118 And they do so by power of what we might call their spatial dramaturgy. It is no coincidence that this phenomenon is in particular evidence in the works of an artist who draws much inspiration from dramatic theater: the installations of Ilya Kabakov. Kabakov, moreover, lends himself to comparison in our context because he--—like Stein——-has published theoretical reflections on his aesthetic program.119  

# (llya Kabakov)  

In Kabakov's installations-—-or at least in those that do not integrate music or recorded voices but confront the viewer solely with a spatial arrangement of static elements-—-the previous!y discussed  

tension initially appears to have been cancelled. For the elements of the installation ostensibly do not change over time; there is thus also no development that might produce a relation of tension with the internal temporality of the aesthetic experience. In fact, Kabakov's installations are reminiscent of a theatrical stage ^when the viewer goes up onto it during the intermission" (TI, 246). They recall abandoned stages in two ways. First, in the sense of an abandoned stage: they are clearly identifiable within the museum context as set-like staged spaces. Their “falsity.” their artificiality, and this is significant for Kabakov, “should not be surmounted" (TI, 246). Second, in the sense of an abandoned stage: Kabakov's arrangements play with the illusion that the space the viewer has entered is a scene that has only just been abandoned—-perhaps only temporarily——-by its agents. The viewer, Kabakov posits, should have the feeling \*that the place where he finds himself has been inhabited for a long time already, that people lived and live in it, furthermore, that they have just left and will return any minute now" (Tl, 276-7). The fact, however, that the viewer of the installation enters the abandoned scene constitutes an important difference from the theatrical stage. Whereas the viewer of a Kabakov installation moves in the abandoned scene, the spectator in the theater-—-even during intermission—-in most cases, at least in traditional theater, looks at it. In this sense, Kabakov's installations might converge with Stein's theater at least with regard to the metaphor of the landscape.120 Like it, they accentuate an aspect of the experience of a landscape. While Stein's landscape theater accentuates the landscape as a “space that is taking place,”" a space which the spectator looks at, Kabakov's installation theater landscapes accentuate a different aspect of the experience of a landscape: the viewer of the installation, like the viewer of a landscape, finds himself within it; he moves amid its objects.121  

The concept that the viewer ought to be completely incorporated into the artificial world of the installation rather than look at it from outside-—-as, for instance, at a stage——-is indeed central to the definition of what Kabakov calls "total" installations. Nothing within the "total" installation should remind one of the museum or gallery space in which it has been installed. The space of the installation itself—with its walls, ceiling. floor-is no less subject to artistic manipulation than the arrangement of things within it.22 \*In its most general form, Kabakov writes. "the definition of the \*total′ installation looks like this: entirely transformed space" (TI, 256). The \*total installation is comparable to a stage set whose fourth wall closes behind the viewera "total closure that may well feel quite oppressive. It is accessible only from within: it cannot be viewed from some neutral position outside of it.123 The viewer can only gain access to it by moving within it. \*Unlike the theater, the viewer behaves in an entirely different way in the total installation,” writes Kabakov, "he does not sit still, but moves about freely around inside of it, finds newer and newer points of examination, viewing either details, or the whole thing, being governed, so it seems, only by his own whim and choice" (TI, 275). Kabakov's installations, something I will come back to in a moment, always permit only a relative view of the whole. Yet something else, it seems, is important to Kabakov at this point: the fact that it only seems as though the viewer of the "total” installation is governed “only by his own whim and choice." For the installation is in fact meant to govern the viewer as much as possible. This would also be one reason why Kabakov, not without some irony, speaks of a "total" installation. (This is at least how I read the quotation marks in the title of his programmatic essay, "On the \*Total’ Installation.") In the "total” installation, Kabakov writes, “the viewer, who has so far felt rather free, like he does when viewing paintings or sculpture, finds himself controlled by the installation when he is near one, in a certain sense, he is its \*victim." But Kabakov qualifies this assertion: \*"he is simultaneously both a 'victim’ and a viewer, who on the one hand surveys and evaluates the installation, and on the other, follows those associations, recollections which arise in him, he is overcome by the intense atmosphere of the total installation” (T1, 245). That, we should hasten to object, is of course structurally the case for all art. The viewer of painting and sculpture, too, is, if you will, free and not free, viewer-agent and victim alike: his production of meaning in relation to the work of art is likewise always a response to the latter that he cannot completely control. And any judgment about art is at least partially determined by the experience one makes with it. But what Kabakov seems to aim at beyond such generalities is the idea of dictating the viewer's movements and perspectives as much as possible through the design of the installation itself. We might object, again, that every installation “directs" its viewer in a certain sense: materials or objects obstruct his passage in more or less calculated fashion; the space of the installation is confined by the architecture, structured by partitions or objects, or open to the surroundings in selected places. Still, the design of an installation can either dramatize or downplay the way the installation directs the viewer.  

Kabakov makes maximum use of the possibility of such dramatization, particularly in his multi-room installations. For, in contrast with installations in which the viewer is confronted by an arrangement of materials seemingly scattered in a single space, however configured, Kabakov's multi-room installations are in part about explicitly incorporating the viewer's trajectory into the artistic calculation. This, of course, does not mean that he assumes that he can completely control the viewer: \*"There is no such thing as an abstract viewer, nor will we find two viewers who behave exactly the same way inside the installation" ( TI, 311). And even the viewer's trajectory cannot really be predetermined. \*"Everything appears not at all this schematic" (TI, 87). Still, the architectonic layout of the installation at least enables Kabakov to literally prescribe the direction of the viewer's movement. Kabakov's installations often have only one possible entrance, and after the viewer has entered, he must follow the unknown architecture from situation to situation through corridors and/or rooms set up in sequence for quite some time until he is finally led to the exit.  

Interestingly, the artistic reflection on the viewer's movement   
through the installation here also explicitly becomes the point of depar  
ture for a construction and design that simultaneously reflects on the   
temporal quality of this movement. Kabakov accordingly stresses that   
"total installation comes close to theater not only with respect to the  
ater's representational character, but also with regard to its character as   
a time-based art (TI, 311). For although, of course, the installation itself   
does not move or change, there is a subject of movement in the instal  
lation: the viewer, a subject whose movement is, according to Kabakov,   
"[what] creates that temporal-spatial aspect of the total installation's   
existence which [...] we will call its drama (Tl, 311 ). Especially the   
"'passage from one space of the installation to another,” he writes, creates that special dramatic effect which allows a series of similar transitions to be played out as a type of unique play, where the viewer and his impression wind up being entirely different at the end of the installation than they were in the beginning. A comparison with a well structured dramatic play here is very appropriate, although what changes in a play occurs along a temporal scale, and in the installation it occurs with the movement from one space into another. (TI, 247)  

What would indeed seem to approximate the spatial logic of the installation to the temporai logic of the theater is the fact that the viewer must pass through the individual spatial situations consecutively. The individual elements of the installation acquire their meaning by virtue of their arrangement in the space, but now no longer in the general sense according to which it always matters where an element is located in the totality of a work of (installation) art, but also in the sense that it makes a difference where it is located along the viewer's trajectory—in other words, when it appears to the viewer in relation to what he has seen before and will subsequently see.  

A spatiotemporal before-and-after effect is generated in the multiple-room installation particularly because such an installation never appears before the viewer's eyes in its totality. Of course, we have to walk around a sculpture to see all of it; and in a one-room installation we have to turn around and move in it to gain access to its totality from various perspectives. Still, the elements of these works of art are, in the situation in which one finds oneself with them, immediately accessible. The multiple-room installation is quite different: the formation of interrelations the viewer performs on the work will here necessarily always refer also to elements that the viewer either has already seen or is yet to see. But, however, they are, like theatrical tableaux in a theatrical performance located in the temporal past or future, literally not immediately accessible-- unless the viewer goes backward or forward, or passes through the installation a second time, which, however, does not solve (but only raises once again) the problem that his gaze captures the installation never in its entirety but alvays only parts of it in sequence. In analogy to the tension that arises in the theater between theatrical signs unfolding in spatial juxtaposition on stage and theatrical events that occur in temporal sequence, Kabakov's multiple-room installations engender a tension between the spatial juxtaposition of the elements of the installation on the one hand and the succession of the encounter with these elements directed by the spectator's own movement on the other. Even the most careful and time-consuming inspection will not resolve this tension but in fact probably even heighten it.  

Kabakov himself, however, seems to be virtually unaware of this  

tension. Instead, he aims to tell a story by way of spatial dramaturgy. A   
prerequisite for such storytelling is that the viewer,\*having entered the   
installation. ought to “immediately understand its plot, what is going   
on here, what it is about" (TI, 316). That the subject of the installation is   
easily determined--for example, a library, a school, a living room, an   
orphanage--should then also explain all the other details and arrange   
them to form a narrative. \*"We have already said, Kabakov writes, that the immobility of objects [in the instailation, as opposed to the theater] is compensated for by the movement of the viewer between them, hence we can say that they, the objects, according to this movement, "arise" before the viewer, beginning suddenly to "resound.,” rather distinctly and loudly to declaim, to "pronounce” their monologue. I have not misspoken. Where there is a plot, a story already exists, a hidden narrative. Objects in the installation, connected internally by the plot, already exist in it in such a way, that it's as though there is a "text" behind them that explains and provides for their presence. Often it's as though this text foats to the surface, like salt from an oversaturated solution, and is present in the \*total installation in the most varied appearances: separate pages-explanations; pages——-commentaries written on small plaques, textual objects in the form of a screen; handwritten and typed books; merely inscriptions. (TI, 293)  

Now, the function of text in Kabakov is by no means always comparable to that of a playbill, providing the spectator with the plot that, as it were, may have occurred or may still occur on the “abandoned stage” of the installation. Yet even in such a case, text will never be able to completely "explain and guarantee” the role of the objects in the installation.'24 And this is the result of general reasons concerning the relation between text and text, between the \*text” of possible interpretations and the text as a component of the installation.  

The "text” that may be suggested by, among other things, the subject of a given installation, that is, the text that exists only in the subjunctive status of an "as if'——it is, Kabakov himself has said, as $i f$ a text stood behind the elements of the installation “explain[ing] and guarantee[ing] their presence"—this “text," which exists solely in the interpretive performances of the subjects of aesthetic experience. is structurally incapable of being fixed. It is forever being written and rewritten, to extend the textual metaphor, in the processes of aesthetic experience. For the discourse of interpretation finds no objective footing in the objects of the installation. It slips off the installation's figurative economy in sometimes embarrassing ways as much as it is incited to new eloquence by this economy. The "'text” (in quotation marks) of this “delirious"125 discourse-—-delirious because it is structurally overflowing——- is therefore also never identical to the actual text (without quotation marks) that may be included in the installation. Such accompanying text may circumscribe a horizon of possible meaning around the installation-and it would seem to be in this sense that Kabakov speaks of, for example, understanding text as “one of the many colors in the overall picture of the total installation" (TI, 319). Yet it cannot prescribe the roles that the elements of the installation will play in the processes of aesthetic experience. By contrast, that the text in the installation may "[float] to the surface, like salt from an oversaturated solution,” quite precisely indicates (if we understand this image not as tautologically as it seems to be suggested by Kabakov in this passage126) the “supplementary” status, as Derrida would callit, of such an accompanying text.127 Text as part of the work--like a color in the total image of the installation-may in fact overflow the entirety of the installation and engender an effect of meaning in relation to the whole installation. Yet at the very moment when it plays a role that is essential or constitutive of meaning, the text as a supplement immediately undermines this role, presenting itself as a mere addition, a minor element in the installation. This might in turn have the effect of highlighting not so much the text's narrative content but its spatial arrangement, a feature that is never absent. Text can never have the function of completely explaining the presence of the various elements in the installation: it instead becomes one element of the installation among many, and as such it enters into the aesthetic play.128  

In a similar fashion, however, the other elements of the installation likewise lead a representational life of their own that is irreducible to the representation of narration, or more generally to the setting of a particular scene. Fried, as we recall, had described this uncanny life of aesthetic objects as "theatrical precisely not because they are limited to the function of symbolizing a narrative or dramatic meaning, but rather because they persistently resist any such symbolization, being doubly legible as things and as signs. Neither does the aesthetic object immediately merge into meaning nor can it be reduced to its own literalness, its thing-like quality, or its objecthood. This is what displaces Kabakov's scenes——-at first glance so ordinary-—-from the realm of reality, the sphere of first-order objecthood. In their aesthetic dual presence as things and signs, the deceptively ordinary objects of Kabakovian scenes disfigure what would otherwise be simply determinable or identifiable: for example, a library, a school, a living room, an orphanage. As objects of art they are, as Sarah Kofman has pointed out, peculiarly undead, disturbing doubles, doppelgangers or ghosts of objects in the real world.i29 This is the structural cause  

for the anxiety that Kabakov's oddly morbid theatrical realism sometimes triggers: the confrontation with Kabakov's "mute scenes" causes anxiety not because, in their ordinariness, they gesture toward an absence of potentially present persons and their actions but because this ordinariness itself always "reveals itself," in viewing these scenes, to be "something not of this world, as belonging to an inaccessible elsewhere."'130 This is also the direction in which we can read Kabakov's almost Heideggerian claim that the meanings and roles of the objects in the installation, their "name,” as he says, “is extraordinarily concentrated, is exacerbated. In a table on display, its "tableness' is magnified, in a closet, its “closetness' (Tl, 292). If we read this passage in the sense not of a hermeneutic magnification (for example, of the table toward its tableness), but of a magnification by virtue of which the table becomes dissimilar to itself—-larger than life, so to speak—-then this genuinely aesthetic disfigurationeffect applies not only to the individual objects in the installation but also to their grouping in a scene: “At the same time, along with the magnification of the meaning of each object individually,"” writes Kabakov, “it's as though an emptiness forms all around it, objects exist individually, not ^adhering' to one another like ‘in real life. That's why in the conditions of the total installation the ‘interval’ between objects, the tense emptiness between them becomes so important' (TI, 292).  

The objects of the installation, then, do not develop certain dramatic qualities because they become part of a dramaturgy of scenes and as such thus refer representationally to a plot, as Kabakov suggests with his idea of a narrative decipherability of dramatically arranged scenes. They do so, rather, because they never permanently form into a scenic totality, and in fact inevitably disfigure themselves time and again vis-a-vis such a totality. The anxiety that is sometimes caused by Kabakov's installations is thus a consequence not primarily of their depiction of disturbing stories, but of the fact that they continually subvert any narrative “explanation" of the objects in a disturbing way. Going from room to room, one can indeed imagine what might have taken place, and perhaps these individual spatial  

situations in this sense-like the changing sets of a play---even refer to the temporal course of a plot. We can imagine that first this happened here, then that there, and so on. As in a hallucination, the viewer is called upon to substitute the staged scenes with a real scenario: in Kabakov's case, it's always a Soviet drama, in which the actors are called into the changing sets one after the other. In view of the provocatively patient stasis of the objects collected in the installation, however, any idea of time represented in or through it inevitably proves quite clearly to be a projection. Narrative interrelations are constantly rejected by the stubborn persistence of the objects in the installation, relations that nonetheless seem to be implied by the arrangement of these objects in the framework of a spatial dramaturgy. Because the meaning of the individual elements in the installation can never be traced back to a narrative meaning that might conclusively explain their place in the totality of the installation, the spatiotemporal synthesis performed by the viewer, which gathers past and future moments (seen further back or to be seen further ahead) of the installation into meaningful interrelations, will inevitably always also prove to be contingent. The viewer is thus once again referred back to the elements of the installation and hence also to new possibilities of spatiotemporal association.  

The consequence is a specifically aesthetic uncertainty, unsettling not only the viewer's relation to the individual objects in the installation but also that to the space of the installation itself. For not only the objects of the installation are potentially meaningful for the viewer, their "interval-like” arrangement in space is as well-intervals may suddenly appear as, for example, a "tense vacuum,” distances as long or short. Like the objects in the installation, the space of the installation is neither simply a factual given, as in, for example, the literalness of its floor plan, nor on the other hand is it easily resolved into a succession of identifiable scenes-—rather, the processes of aesthetic experience set it in a motion that does not come to rest either in a positivistic determination of spatial dimensions nor in one particular meaningful coherence. This event-like quality of the space of installation is “dramatic" not so much because its dramaturgical organization can be related representationally to the course of a dramatic plot but because it dramatically exceeds this possibility. And this is why the effect of Kabakov's installations is more than the stale spectacle a visitor to a haunted house ride experiences, which can be calculated based on the foor plan. Instead, his installations yield at times uncanny effects because the viewer's experience feels entirely unplanned. These effects, and not a “directing” of the viewer (which is, in any case, possible only to a very limited extent), constitutes the aesthetic point of what Kabakov sometimes calls the "repressive" asperts of the experience of his "total" installations.  

In fact, even the movements of the viewer, which potentially constitute meaning, will inevitably prove to be contingent. On the one hand, this is the reason for the latent disorienting effect of the installation, for the viewer's sense of having lost his ability of pragmatic orientation in space, or rather, for the vague impression that this ability will get him nowhere in aesthetic terms. On the other hand, however, it is also the reason why the viewer will tend to lose his sense of time while in the installation (TI, 316). Because the viewer's movements cannot be synchronized with the time of any imagined plot, a tension inevitably arises between the limited real time of walking through the installation and the fundamentally indefinite time of aesthetic experience. The unease that frequently results from this tension-—-of not having seen everything, of having paid too much attention to the wrong things in the installation, of having taken in the general atmosphere rather than focusing on a few details at odds with the atmosphere, or, in general, of having walked too fast—-reflects the fact that the time of the aesthetic experience can only be limited by an uncompelled decision to leave, that its end will inevitably be arbitrary.  

That the temporality of aesthetic experience, even if we focus as much as possible on the represented time of the dramatic events, is irreducible to the time of theatrical performance was the point of departure for Gertrude Stein's aesthetics of theater. A similar-though, in a sense, inverse-—-phenomenon is reflected, as we have seen, in Ilya Kabakov's installations. Whereas Stein's critical analysis of the tensions between these three modes of temporality in dramatic theater marks the point of departure for her own aesthetics of theater,  

Kabakov's installations exhibit a tension between the time of the aesthetic experience and the time of walking through an installation—-and precisely where we assumed that he seriously intended to synchronize them by evoking a dramatic plot. We have seen, moreover, that Stein's and Kabakov's media-reflective strategies are functional complements precisely because they refer to drama in opposite ways: whereas Stein's landscape theater provokes intensified reffection on time as a means of representation by, among other factors, no longer representing a dramatic plot, Kabakov's theatrical installation landscapes provoke refection on the representational potential of the installation space because, among other factors, their stage set-likeness on the one hand and their dramaturgical organization on the other suggest a dramatic plot with its represented temporality. Stein's and Kabakov's strategies thus prove to be reflective in relation, among other things. to the structural problems of their own art genres (visual arts. theater) precisely in their attempts to explicitly (Kabakov) or implicitly (Stein) move toward the other genre.  

The difference between an explicit, intentional transgression of the boundaries between the arts and an approximation to another art implicit in the logic of the particular art an artist specializes in was, however, central to Adorno's distinction between legitimate fraying and illegitimate unification. If we set aside the problem that another central component of Adorno's conception of art is the artistic production of aesthetic coherence, which Stein's landscape theater conspicuously and specifically undermines, Stein would here come to stand on the side of legitimate fraying, as she derives the concept of landscape theater from an engagement of the structural problems of theater itself, whereas we would have to locate Kabakov on the side of illegitimate unification because he attempts to imitate another art, that of dramatic theater, by means of visual art. The legitimate critique of the basis of this distinction in Adorno notwithstanding, the question ultimately needs to be addressed—with regard to a dimension of the notion of the "total"" installation we have not yet discussed-whether it is, as a distinction, entirely without critical relevance. For the notion of the "total" installation-—-and this is obviously perfectly intentional in Kabakov (Tl, 17, 26) --also suggests the association with the gesamtkunstwerk.  

But Kabakov is not interested in dissolving the boundaries between art and life—-his installations are marked as ontologically distinct spaces, as spaces of art even when they allude to sites of ritual (TI, 338-42) or open up to their real surroundings (TI, 330-7). Nor does Kabakov really pursue the project of a “unification" of all arts. Instead, his incorporation of other arts and art genres (painting, music, spoken or written literature) into the “"total installation always takes place under the aegis of traditional theater. The latter has always proven to be especially capable of such incorporation. It is not by chance that it has often been taken as the point of departure for the idea of a gesamtkunstwerk. Like traditional theater, however, Kabakov's installations, due to their aspiration to totality, have only a limited ability to integrate; as such integration comes at the cost of suppressing individual arts. The paintings we sometimes see in "total" installations, for example, are not “real." They appear to be citations of painting, theatrical props---and they do not claim to be anything else. Music is different. Due to its reproducibility, it is employed, as it were, "as such." Like painting, however, music is ultimately also expected to fit into the uniform impression made by the “total installation. Whereas the concerted arrangement of music, visual arts, and performing arts in dramatic theater takes place under the authority-—-though such authority is never completeof the drama, or rather of the dramatic plot, Kabakov's installations, and this is the decisive difference, only suggest dramatic action. This has the effect that the individual arts--literature, music, visual arts—-become in part independent from one another and exhibit their structural differences even where their function is to integrate themselves into the atmospheric total impression of the installation.131  

Against the tendency toward controlling, drecting, and repressing the viewer, toward narrative closure and an integrative suppression of the individual arts-—a tendency which no doubt resonates in the notion and conception of the \*total" installation—-I think we ought to understand the aspiration of this installation to totality as decidedly ironic: to take the failure of the \*total" installation to live up to this aspiration seriously as an aesthetic phenomenon. For then we see that it is precisely by virtue of this failure that the “total" installation plays quite an ironic game with dramatic theater's aspiration to totality, to which it alludes in order to exhibit its ultimate structural impossibility. Because drama cannot have a more than supplementary status in the installation, the \*total installation highlights those aspects that in traditional theater already work against the experience of an exclusive presentness of the dramatic events: the dual structure of aesthetic signs and the tension between the simultaneity of different theatrical signs on the one hand, and the dramatic development on the other. The latter is even heightened by the fact that theatrical development is replaced in the installation by a literal “course" directed or navigated by the viewer himself. To this extent one might say that the structural problems of the dramatic theater emerge precisely as the latter is adapted by another art form. In this sense, Kabakov's installations can indeed be taken to exemplify the reflective potential of an art that gains its strength from working on the structures of another. And this with regard not only to their ability to reffectively bring out the structural problems of dramatic theater by means of visual art but also to the fact that the adaptation of dramatic theater via visual art has engendered a new hybrid art genre——-that of the "total installation --that simultaneously exhibits a structural aspect of this visual art with unusual clarity: the representational potential of the space of exhibition or, rather, installation. Because the reflection on the exhibition space is generally a central characteristic of installation art, I will discuss this set of issues in more detail in part 3.  

In the present context, the "total installation is exemplary of not least a type of installation art for which the diagnosis that installation art is to some extent particularly theatrical is in fact correct. Something similar applies to the stage-like installations of artists ranging from Paul Thek, Mike Kelley, and Paul McCarthy, to Cosima von Bonin and Kai Althoff —-the list could go on. The same could be said, if in a different way, for all those installations recognizably rooted in the diverse practices of Happening and performance artists. The group of artists to whose work this applies to some degree ranges from Robert Rauschenberg, Alan Kaprow, Rebecca Horn, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, and, again, Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy, to Jonathan Meese and John Bock—this list, too, could go on. And certainly there are diverse intersections in many of the artists whose names I have mentioned between stage-like installations (some of them include figures arranged as “actors,”’ as in Thek's and Althoff's work) and installations built from the remnants or traces of a Happening or performance piece. In all these (otherwise unquestionably very distinct) cases, the elements of the installation evoke a past or future factual or fictional event, in relation to which the event character of the installation itself, constituted solely by the viewer's aesthetic processes of understanding, nonetheless inevitably becomes independent. For this character is constituted only in and through the engagement of the viewer. This feature, I hope, has become particularly clear in the example of Kabakov's spatial dramaturgy. We can generally note, then, that theatrical installations develop their strength in latent reference to, and in necessary distinction from, the time-based art of the theater.  

Things are quite different, of course, in installations that integrate or exhibit a time-based art, such as cinematographic or sound installations. But as we will see, these art forms likewise labor against a conception of aesthetic experience based on the aesthetics of presentness and mediated by an objectivist notion of the synchronicity of the receiving subject and the work. I will demonstrate this first for cinematographic installation.  

# (Boris Groys, Walter Benjamin)  

In the late sixties, the moving image found its way into institutions dedicated to the visual arts. These days, one would be hard pressed to find a museum of contemporary art without a darkened room showing one of the many and varied works that could be called cinematographic in the broadest sense, or a museum in which the white cube, the traditional exhibition space, is not accompanied by at least one black box. In the following I will refrain from discussing the undoubtedly significant media-technological and media-historical differences between film and video as well as the vast variety of related artistic practices. Instead, I will restrict my remarks to a few considerations regarding what I would like to call cinematographic installation in general; an art form for which presentation in the black box is especially important. This form of installation has its most significant point of reference not in the television screen but in the cinema-—and this concerns the conditions of its presentation as well as those of its reception.  

Unlike theatrical installation, which, as it were, borrows the problems of the theater, cinematographic installation has its very origin in film or, more precisely, in experimental film. The development of cinematographic installation therefore stands in the context of a movement in which \*a new claim was advanced $[\ldots]$ for the right of film, as of poetry or painting, to break away from both realism and didacticism, from documentary and fiction, in order to refuse to tell a story I...] and even to create forms and movements instead of copying them from nature."132 In contradistinction, however, to the significant role the respective avant-garde movements have played in painting and literature as a whole, the filmic avant-garde has always been considered a marginal phenomenon.133 For what seemed most important about film was not so much its potential artistic quality but the feature that constitutes it as a cultural-technological phenomenon: the ability to make a world in motion appear. This ability has been seen as the genuine possibility of the new medium, if we think of, for example, Kracauer's materialist definition of film as a means of rescuing extra-aesthetic reality,I34 of Panofsky's dictum that the substance of film is the moving image, its material being external reality as such,135 or of Cavell's definition of the medium of film as a “succession of automatic world projections."136 Seen from rical" voyeurism in a virtually mechanical fashion demonstrates merely that the identification of voyeurism with aesthetic consciousness (which, as we saw in the first chapter, is systematically misleading) also provides the background to his theory of film. Accordingly, his view of classical Hollywood cinema is defined by an aesthetics of presentness: the moviegoer, claims Cavell, does not witness the events on the screen the way the spectator in the theater views the dramatic  

this perspective, experimental film could not but occupy a marginal position. For it was obviously not bound to the task of making a world in motion appear -indeed, it shunned this task in favor of free artistic command over the means of film. Still, it would be misleading to suggest that a reflection on the cinematic means of representation, highlighting the latter at the expense of what they represent (the world in motion), has been a feature of experimental film and its reception alone. It is probably not by chance that since the fifties, feature films by directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Alain Resnais, Ingmar Bergman. or Orson Welles have often been called \*"art films." In the context of phenomena in film reception and distribution-such as "European film.," the emergence of "art house film theaters, the discourse of the \*seventh art," and the so-called politique des auteursthe term "art film" was meant to distinguish such work not only from commercial Hollywood cinema. Rather, it also designated, whether intentionally or not, an impulse to leave the primacy of motion and the linear narrative mode it privileges behind in favor of increasing reflection on, or denaturalization of, cinematic representation.137 This impulse, which Gilles Deleuze associated with modern cinema in general, already also implies a tendency toward "fraying": toward an increasing spatialization of the time-based art of film, which, until then, was largely defined in terms of a recording of empirical movements: and toward a growing mutual independence of sound and image, as well as a growing independence of the individual shot as opposed to its integration into the larger meaning of, for example, a storyline. Moreover, the relative independence of the individual shot and the associated heightened significance of the interval between the individual images imply an increasing reflection on time, which here no longer appears as merely derivative of movement, as time represented indirectly, but comes to the fore in the dimension of representation itself.138  

In experimental film of the sixties, the reflection on the cinematic means was stepped up one degree: it now extended not only to the cinematic means of representation, but also to the cinematic forms of presentation.139 The entire cinematographic apparatus was no longer to be concealed in service of the story but, on the contrary, to be exhibited and made available for increased reflection on itand, importantly, to an audience no longer "hypnotized" by its immersiveillusionist effects but instead actively interested in its means. It was necessary to expose the entire cinematic apparatus: this meant exhibiting, and reflecting on, not only its means of representation (camera, light, editing, and so on) but also its forms of presentation (dark room, projection on a vertical screen, frontal arrangement of seats). By denaturalizing these forms, their conventionality could also become thematic. This was the birth of cinematographic installation. It sought to transform the black box of the cinema, a magical space, into an exhibition space; to release the conscious activity of the audience from its illusionist, spellbound latency—-and, at least potentially, to unleash it into the productivity of an aesthetic experience: cinema was tobecome art.  

Cinematographic installation breaks with cinema and its forms of presentation in the first place simply by abandoning it in favor of an art institution. And one might think that this operation alone lends the film material presented in the installation the aura of art. Indeed, cinematographic installation seems to have enabled a tangible auratization (in the sense at least of one definition of "aura” offered by Walter Benjamin in his famous essay on the work of art 40) precisely of what. according to Benjamin, is more than anything else symptomatic for the decline of the aura in the twentieth century: flm. For the decline of the aura. according to Benjamin, is a consequence of the tendency among the masses, fostered by the technology of reproduction, to take control of the world of things, to make them available to the subject: "the desire of the present-day masses to \*get closer' to things. and their equally passionate concern for overcoming each thing's uniqueness by assimilating it as a reproduction" (WA, 105). If. for the moment, we set aside the fact that Benjamin recognizes above all a legitimate call for more participation in art and culture in this tendency. then, we might be tempted to see—albeit more in line with Adorno than with Benjamin--an expression also of instrumental reason in this demand for availability. Precisely to the degree that we, along with Benjamin, might recognize the decisive cultural agent of this development (which is in any case ambivalent) in film, the cinematographic installation appears, at least in one respect, as its counteragent: against the mass dissemination and universal availability of film (and, even more so, of video), cinematographic installation posits its singular presentation in the exhibition space. Of course, the aura the museum installation thus confers on film remains external to the latter -for the technological reproducibility of filrm is an inalienable feature of this industrial medium. Still, despite this reproducibility, installation restores to film, if not the quality of genuineness or originality. then at least an auratic uniqueness. This holds true even when a few reproductions of the same work circulate: the material presented in the cinematographic installation is not available to the viewer other than in the here and now of its current installation on site. But even with respect to the criterion of uniqueness, this auratization of film through installation has certain limits. For on the one hand the uniqueness of a cinematographic installation no longer has a religious or cultic foundation---as was the case for artworks with an aura in Benjamin's sense-—-and on the other hand, museums, too, have largely become democratically accessible places. If in this context we wish to speak of aura at all, this would be an aura emancipated from the “parasitical subservience to ritual (WA, 106), one that has, over the course of history, become autonomous and largely democratically accessible.  

But even to put it this way is misleading, since the quality of uniqueness would be precisely no longer decisive for such an art. Art is not founded on simple opposition to mass culture. The possibility of an art that would be auratic in a post-metaphysical sense is not predicated on recovering the uniqueness of the work of art against the conditions of its technological reproducibility. The uniqueness of the work of art may, in a way we will examine more closely in a moment, be a particular aesthetic possibility of the cinematographic installation; it is not a required criterion for an art that would be auratic in a postmetaphysical sense. For characteristic of the latter is not so much the quality of uniqueness but rather, as I have argued, a specifically aesthetic withdrawal of the aesthetic object, however reproduced it may be, in the interpretive processes that constitute aesthetic experience. From the perspective of a theory of experience, the concept of aura would then also not be tied to an elitist limitation of its accessibility. Instead, we would have to distinguish categorically between accessibility in the sense of democratic participation and accessibility in the sense of complete comprehensibility. Nonetheless, this interpretation of the auratic “apparition of a distance, however near it may be” (WA, 105), presupposes a conceptual liberation of the aura from its significance in Benjamin's philosophy of history.  

For a post-metaphysically auratic art--and this has to be noted in the present context-is not in fact something the Benjamin of the "Work of Art'? essay would describe as desirable; according to him, an aura under secularized conditions would be possible only on the basis of an escapist theology that would divest art of all social function and would ultimately serve the ruling classes as a vacuous beautiful semblance, I'art pour Il'art. Consequently, according to Benjamin, the response to the declining bourgeois form of aura must also be avant-gardistic destruction. This perspective, at any rate, determines Benjamin's assessment of the transformation of the concept of art entailed by technological reproducibility. For technological reproducibility not only emancipates the work of art "for the first time in world history [..] from the parasitical dependence on ritual?? (WA, 106) but -with its possibilities for a democratic mass culturereplaces a religious or cultic basis of art with a political one.  

The most important symptom of this shift--which Benjamin regards   
with considerable revolutionary hope—-is that the “exhibition value"   
of a work of art loses its dependence on its ritual-organized “cult   
value." "The scope for exhibiting the work of art," Benjamin writes, has increased so enormously with the various methods of technologically reproducing it that, as happened in prehistoric times, a quantitative shift between the two poles of the artwork has led to a qualitative transformation in its nature. Just as the work of art in prehistoric times, through the exclusive emphasis placed on its cult value, became first and foremost an instrument of magic which only later came to be recognized as a work of art, so today, through the exclusive emphasis placed on its exhibition value, the work of art becomes a construct [Gebilde] with quite new functions. Among these, the ones we are conscious of--the artistic functionmay subsequently be seen as incidental. This much is certain: today, film is the most serviceable vehicle of this new understanding. (WA.106-7)  

For Benjamin, the fact that exhibition value becomes independent is not merely the precondition of a secularized art fully emancipated from ritual; it is at the same time an indication of a dialectical reversal of this emancipation into its opposite--into the abolition of the autonomy art had just recently gained in favor of a new social function of art, which, precisely because of the loss of its aura, once again approximates it to the cultic function. In the example of film, Benjamin explains, we can recognize a transformation of the function of art. It no longer simply exists for its own sake and for the sake of the contemplative experience of it, which, as Benjamin writes in the wake of the Fascist usurpation of a "traditional" notion of art (WA, 102), "became a breeding ground for asocial behavior” "as the bourgeoisie degenerated" (WA, 119). Instead, art should now take on a function similar to the one cultic art had served in "prehistoric times." Following the model of film, the art of the future ought to render people resistant to the demands of a society now thoroughly shaped by technology. “The function of film,” Benjamin writes, “is to train human beings in the apperceptions and reactions needed to deal with a vast apparatus whose role in their lives is expanding  

almost daily" (WA, 108). The rapid succession of images in film creates a "shock effect" that “seeks to induce heightened attention” (WA, 132). Film, he concludes, is thus “the art form corresponding to the pronounced threat to life in which people live today. It corresponds to profound changes in the apparatus of apperception-- changes that are experienced on the scale of private existence by each passerby in big-city traffic, and on the scale of world history by each fighter against the present social order” (WA, 132).  

However today's ideological critique might judge this highly ambivalent assessment of the cultural-political function of the medium of film as an instrument meant to simultaneously serve both habituation and resistance to the circumstances of modern life, if we consider the bulk of commercial film production or of subsequent pop-cultural phenomena such as, most recently, the computer game, it is probably clear that the great revolutionary hopes that Benjamin—-in a variation on certain Brechtian motifs—-associated with film have not been fulflled. But it is also clear today, and this is significant for our context, that film, particularly in and of itself, has not served as the vanguard for a more general change in the function of art that Benjamin diagnosed. The fact that exhibition value has become independent has not led to the sublation of art into cultural politics but, at most, to a new form of art: installation is one decisive response of an art liberated from the external purposes of religion or cult—a functionally autonomous art—to the condition of its nearly universal capacity to be exhibited. This response takes the form of an art that is itself essentially exhibition. I will discuss this connection in greater detail later (3.2.1).  

In this line of argument, however, art is conceived in a way that neither fetishizes it as beautiful semblance nor absorbs it into life in a cultural-revolutionary sublation. Here, art is founded neither on a religious or cultic nor on a political basis. Nor is its concept dependent on specific qualities of the object--not on that of duration or on that of feetingness; not on that of originality or on that of reproducibility. The restitution of the value of uniqueness in installation art, then, does not in itself ensure the artistic character of the film materials presented. This quality, I have argued, is ultimately rooted  

purely in the judgment implicit in an experience whose object proves elusive time and again in a way that is constitutive of this experience. In this conceptual perspective, Karl Kraus's aphorism, "The closer the look one takes at a word, the greater the distance from which it looks back $\because1+1$ which Benjamin often cited in the context of his concept of aura, describes an aspect of elusiveness of the work of art that resists all political or otherwise instrumental service. In this sense, however. film can be auratic, too. For this understanding of the aura need not be traced back to religious or cultic elements; it requires only an explication of the specifically aesthetic experience the film material may occasion.  

The cinematographic installation, whose particular qualities are at issue here, has. in contrast to cinema, different ways of bringing out what constitutes the aesthetic potential of film. It possesses these other means because it radically changes the conditions of the presentation of moving images. Supported by the electronic image,142 among other factors, the installation format enables an engagement of the cinematographic order of space that treats it as one convention among many. The moving image in the installation is not tied to any particular presentation format. It is dispersed across several monitors or screens; it appears on the floor, across a corner, on the ceiling, in the middle of the room; it enters into relation with other objects in the room; it can be minuscule or overwhelmingly large.  

The concept of cinematographic installation thus refers to the fundamental conditions not of the technical medium but, as I have already indicated above, to those of the cinema. As early as the seventies, film artists developed installation as a form that allowed for critical reflection on the apparatus of cinema—-that is, the constellation of darkened room, frontal positioning of the audience, vertical screen, film, and projection. Furthermore, the defamiliarizing exhibition of the cinematographic means of presentation not only leads in most cases to the anti-illusionist domino effect by which a reflection on the filmic means of representation is also entailed, but at the same time potentially prompts the viewer to engage in a self-reflective, performative, that is, aesthetic relation to the (objects of the) installation as well.  

The cinematographic installation, however, particularly invites such relation not only because it breaks with the conventional form of presentation for moving images, but also because the viewer of the instailation, unlike the cinematic spectator placed in front of the screen, can usually move freely in this installation. Seating is in fact usually very limited or not present at all, and so the viewer finds himself in various positions in relation to the moving images-—-as well as to the technical apparatus, which is often part of the exhibition. The art theorist Boris Groys concludes that such art helps overcome a formerly passive attitude toward the moving image. At least since the sixties, the idea of a passive audience “manipulated” by the immersive illusionism of conventional narrative cinema has indeed motivated many filmic art practices to take critical countermeasures.143 But the literal, that is, the physical immobilization of the spectator in the cinema, which Groys believes inevitably leads to intellectual immobility,14 is the smallest problem in this context.  

For the possibility of an activity of consciousness liberated from latency into the productivity of an aesthetic experience is not tied to the individual viewer's freedom of physical movement. It is obviously also available in cinema, at least in principle, as is exemplifed by, but not limited to, experimental or art film. Even in classical narrative cinema, the activity of the spectator's consciousness may in principle be heightened, to the point where the cinematic experience finally undergoes a qualitative shift away from the dreamlike state of entertainment toward a different experience: an aesthetic one. I will come back to this point later. But installation art has its own specific means to bring out the generally self-reflective, performative character of an qesthetic (film) experience. For the viewer of the installation creates relations with it, between its elements, and by virtue of his own physical activity--that is, by moving inside it and regarding it from various perspectives. Like Minimal art, film installation, too, seems particularly capable of highlighting this fundamental feature of aesthetic experience.  

The transformation of the cinematographic conditions of reception in installation, then, seems to me to be a matter not so much of the purely physical mobilization of the viewer but rather of the individualization of his filmic experience. The spectator in cinema is part of an audience; the viewer of cinematographic installation, due to the physical freedom of movement as well as a condition of presentation that is constitutively unfamiliar—-because it is different in each case, that is. individual-—-is left to his own devices. He will reflect on the fact that the installation does not assign him a defined position. This not originally about something else. The film as such therefore remains in the zone of speechlessness. But why this speechlessness, why this discursive failure? [...] The visitor to the cinema [...] is placed into a situation of absolute powerlessness, of paralysis, of immobility. And this also means, into a situation of powerlessness in relation to language, to discursive praxis. [...] The ability to move freely in space is a necessary precondition for the emergence and further development of a thinking that can be put into language. In a typical film screening, however $[\dots]$ it is the filmic image that moves, that unfolds in time, whereas the viewer remains passive. So the moveiment of the filmic image supplants the movement of thinking and language in the viewer. [...] A film installation in a museum, by contrast creates the ideal space for an analytical and linguistic engagement of the filmic image.

constitutes a crucial difference from the cinematic spectator. For in contradistinction to theater, the individual seating position in cinema holds relatively little significance. The spectator does not watch what takes place within the framed space of the stage from a particular (more or less privileged) distanced position, but is instead positively "drawn along"—together with everyone else in the audience——-by the dynamic space of the film's action.145 Whereas, then, the cinema spectator tends to forget his position by virtue of assimilation into the dynamic space of the film action, the visitor to the film installation will in most cases, at least in the aesthetically more interesting ones, reflect on his position in space. And he will do so with regard also to the machinery, which is more or less explicitly exhibited: the screen, the light, the projector, and their arrangement in space. Like the Minimalist situation, cinematographic installations are particularly inclusive in that, among other reasons, they remain emphatically open as to what qualifies as part of the aesthetic object and what does not. So the viewer—-like the viewer of Minimalist arrangements---will experience cinematographic installation in an important sense as his situation, even if he should happen not to be alone in the installation at any given moment.146 This is because he, and he alone, must decide what he does in the installation and for how long. He will reflect on his productivity in the creation of interrelations with/within the installation among other reasons because here—-unlike in cinema——it is not clear, even in purely spatial terms, what the object of his observation should really be, what it is all really about.  

Furthermore, however—-and this is the truly interesting point in the context of our considerations on the installation-style exhibition of time-based arts --the viewer's freedom of individual movement brings the distinction between the temporality of his experience and that of the film material into especially clear relief. This is so for a reason just mentioned: in cinematographic installation not only the film material but also the spatial aspect of the arrangement of the installation can become the object of aesthetic experience. But the distinction between experiential time and that of the material also shapes the viewer's confrontation with the film material itself.  

In this confrontation, cinematographic installation proves with particular clarity to be a hybrid between visual arts and cinema: it is neither one nor the other but both at the same time. Not only does the viewer find himself surprisingly confronted with a time-based art upon entering the white cube --a setting traditionally reserved for the visual, that is, following Lessing, spatial arts. Cinematographic installation, unlike cinema, at the same time also leaves it up to the viewer to decide how long this encounter with the film material will last--quite as though it were another work of spatial art. But since the object at hand, the moving film image, is nonetheless changing in time, the museum or gallery visitor can no longer come to his object and then walk away without incurring the uncomfortable sense of having missed something significant. \*With the introduction of the moving image into the museum,” Groys writes in his reflections on the film installation already cited above, "the situation changes [... drastically, for moving images begin to dictate the time of the viewing experience—-and rob the viewer of his usual autonomy."147 The viewer, according to Groys, faces the alternative of either submitting to the temporality of the film installation or walking awaybut in the latter case he is no longer competent to pass judgment on the work. "A film installation has a fundamental tendency," Groys writes, "to elude any aesthetic judgment, because the complete and clear viewing of an artwork, which alone could legitimate a conclusive judgment of this artwork, in the case of the film installation is radically called into question."148 From the perspective of a theory of experience, the notion that a “complete and clear viewing” is a precondition of aesthetic judgment would seem problematic even in the case of painting. Still, Groys zeroes in on an important aspect of the viewer's experience of cinematographic installation (and this is the point I am interested in here): his insecurity with regard to how long he ought to remain in the installation.  

This insecurity applies in particular to those cinematographic installations whose organization is calculated to create an “incomplete and unclear viewing." The respective spaces produce a feeling of being overwhelmed in the viewer via projecting a variety of film material scattered through a room. Whichever position he adopts, he can never keep all the projections in the room in sight at the same time. Such strategies of overwhelmment are comparable to maximalist theatrical aesthetics that, precisely by using an abundance of very different processes taking place at the same time, seem to call on the viewer, or rather the spectator, to relate them to one another, to do justice to their spatial simultaneity. This lends a profile or, as it were, plasticity to the tension (which is generally—-if often only latently—operative in the reception of film and theater) between what develops in juxtaposition on the screen or stage and what happens consecutively over time. Consequentially, in turn, the tension between the fundamental inconclusiveness of an always selective and contingent formation of significant interrelations with/within the work, on the one hand, and the temporal development of each work or part of a work, on the other, can also become thematic in reflection.  

Yet the viewer's insecurity--we might also say, by way of Gertrude Stein, his nervousness--with regard to the duration of his stay in the cinematographic installation cannot in all cases be traced to a “physical inability imposed by temporal constraints to view the material form of the artwork in its entirety."149 Many installations confront the viewer with only one projection showing a very short piece of film in an endless loop. An initial insecurity in view of such works, which would seem to lend themselves to a “complete and clear view  

148 Ibid., 12.   
149 Ibid.  

ing." arises from the fact that a visit to a cinematographic installatior is not bound to the temporal unit of the work in question. What causes insecurity, then, is the fact that, in contradistinction to a visit to the cinema, which is structured by the time of the screening, the time of a visit to an installation is not strictly dictated by the installation itself. One enters it at a certain point in time and leaves at what is inevitably an arbitrary point in time—-at any time. In my opinion, we ought to speak of installations only in cases where the work operates with this structure of temporal openness, that is, work that reflects on the specific conditions of its presentation and reception: and not--as has unfortunately become quite common— where a film is shown in a specially darkened museum or gallery space or a video is shown on a monitor set up on a pedestal or projected on a wall. (In fact, it should become customary to show such works only at scheduled times.)  

Because such a reflection on the conditions of presentation and reception is a significant aspect of cinematographic installation, I will now discuss procedures used to organize filmic materials that reflect the conditions of reception in installations (which might be one of the reasons why installation artists use them quite frequently): the loop, hyper slow motion, and duration. But the fact that their use is so widespread, as is that of multiple projections and split screen, with which they are often combined, is not the primary reason why I am interested in them. I will discuss them individually and in detail because they stand as examples for a number of possible ways of organizing filmic materials that perform an artistic reflection on the tension between the temporality of film and that of the experience of it, which generally arises when the experience of film is emancipated from the compulsion to synchronize itself with the events presented: when it becomes an aesthetic experience.  

The loop. Because endless repetition denaturalizes filmic presentation, film loops have become a virtual embodiment of anti-illusionism in film, allowing for heightened reflection on this means of presentation.150  

![images/02b6f026627cb0be383cc172cb8aa6bfd2c2673276e508c2d00940a2bbaf21b8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rF7xoqy.jpeg)  

The indefiniteness of the loop also confronts the viewer in a particular way with the time of his own experience vis-a-vis the time of the film or video. This is the case especially when looping is not merely used by a museum to enable visitors who enter a space after a film has begun to see it in its entirety without having to wait for the film to start anew. In such cases, the uninterrupted repetition of the filmic action merely has the same significance it has in porn theaters or that it had in the early days of cinema before the introduction of scheduled screenings, when visitors simply showed up whenever they liked: repetition here marks the point when a viewer has “seen everything\* and can leave. But in these cases the infinite loop is not an interesting means of cinematographic installation art. The infinity of the loop becomes interesting only when the repetitive structure of the loop is itself part of the structure of the work, inviting the viewer to stay in the installation rather than being a sign telling him to leave. I would like to draw on two examples for a brief illustration of this effect of the loop in installation art.  

In Bruce Yonemoto's film installation The Time Machine (1999) two lilies appear projected on a screen, one real and one artificial; both bloom and fade in endless repetition. The real liy is filmed in time lapse——that is, shot every couple of hours-—-while the artifcial lily, made of clay, is altered through animation, frame by frame: a direct citation of a classic of film history, George Pal's film adaptation of H. G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895). Pal's The Time Machine (1960) is a science fiction film whose main special effects (later appropriated by Yonemoto) --time lapse and claymation --serve to visualize the machine's travel through time. Yonemoto's version of The Time Machine introduces these effects to thematize the techniques enabling the representation of time in film; it does so not least by means of looping. The infinite repetition of the extremely accelerated cycle of life and death-—-in which the two lilies bloom and fade-- denaturalizes the filmic representation of time, enabling a heightened reflection on the means of this representation. While the looped life cycle of the lilies thus refers to the dimension of time represented, the projector, which is set up in the same room as the filmic image it projects, mechanically presents the linear time of filmic representation. The  

projector steadily runs the endless $16~\mathrm{mm}$ loop through its apparatus.  

Yet, besides enabling a reflective thematization of the double time of film--the time it represents and the time of that representation---an exhibition of such has a second effect. For between these two modes of time--the time represented and the time of representation—-another time enters that makes itself felt more strongly the longer an installation is viewed, a time that does not coincide with either of the other two: the time of aesthetic experience. Viewing the lilies endlessly bloom and fade, accompanied by the mechanical whirring of the projector, we gradually lose any sense of an accordance between the two times of the machine (its own and that represented by it) on the one hand, and the time of the viewing on the other. The indefinite identical repetition of the loop does not correspond to the potential infinity of an experience that sees--that must see—the blooming and fading newly and differently over and over again: of an experience that is constitutively non-mechanical.  

Like traditional dramatic theater, conventional narrative cinema implies the idea that the time of the audience should converge, by virtue of empathic identification, with the time of the dramatic events --that the time of aesthetic experience should come to coincide with the time of the film screening as the viewer focuses on the action represented (and less on its representation). In comparison with the theater, narrative cinema would seem to come significantly closer to realizing this ideal thanks to the illusionism enabled by the technology of the "dream factory." The influence of the moving camera would seem to minimize our ability to perceive individual shots as tableaux or images, whose internal complexity might emerge from the course of events. And even the internal tension of the double structure of aesthetic signs--the theatrical actor, as we saw, is a vivid example of this tension—would seem to be reduced to a minimum in film: in some respects, film amalgamates the actor and his role more closely than the theater ever could. As a rule, the role does not exist independently of the actor; there are no characters in the theatrical sense, only types that are first and foremost defined by the stars that are “cast'" to play them once. That is also why stars, in contradistinction to stage actors, are essentially non-ex  

changeable.151 Of course, aesthetic tensions---between the individual shot and the larger narrative, between star and role, or in general, between a representation and what it represents-can never be entirely suspended. But they can emerge in varying degrees and labor against the ideal of synchronizing the filmic experience with the represented plot in different ways. I now turn to my second example, in which the structure of the loop is used in the context of an anti-illusionist revision of narrative cinema and the modes of its reception.  

In Stan Douglas's video instaliation Win, Place or Show (1998) a veritable narrative plot seems to return every six minutes; but the work undermines the certainty that recognition connotes-—-that everything has been seen and is over and done with. There are, of course, the usual recognition effects when, after six minutes, the action begins to repeat. But this "loop,"unlike that of Yonemoto's The Time Machine, does not repeat the action identically: it displaces it with every repetition. Bob and Donny, the two protagonists in Win, Place or Show, become embroiled in a fight-which, at a certain point, inevitably culminates in a brawl—-about news, radio, conspiracy theories, and horse races; but this fight changes slightly with each repetition. A computer selects the shots based on a random generator such that the same sequence is unlikely to return before 20,000 hours, or more than two years. It would of course be impossible, not to mention undesirable, to wait for this moment. In the end, we would probably not even recognize it when it does take place. Something else is obviously at stake in this work, which, given the potential for digital intervention, also does not permit a “complete and clear viewing."  

To begin with, Douglas's practice should surely be described as anti-illusionist. This is true also with regard to the fact that Win, Place or Show consists of a double projection that divides the movie screen in the middle along a blurred line. More importantly, the action was filmed from different camera perspectives, and so the individual shots composed in the double projection by the random generator are sometimes more and other times less compatible. This undermines any illusion of a face-to-face confrontation between the two protagonists (shot and countershot sometimes clearly shooting past one another) or a homogenous space of action. The work obviously exhibits cinematic narrative techniques in order to avoid any kind of illusionist effect and to render identification with/of the plot impossible in favor of a reflection on the various dimensions of the representation (the actors, the postwar modernist set, the lights, the camera position, the editing). Yet Win, Place or Show plays not only with the viewer's capacity to recognize the individual shots in ever-new contexts but simultaneously also with his ability to create interrelations between the shots. Douglas's anti-illusionist method shows precisely that the viewer's active creation of interrelations is inevitable.  

Even what we would call the pre-aesthetic filmic experience is essentially tied to this activity. This is already demonstrated by the fact that we not only see films differently after time has passed, but that every individual sees films differently than anyone else, and even with each viewing. As banal as it may sound, the constitution of a "filmic world' is tied to what constitutes the "world" of a film for the spectator, that is, to what appears significant to him at any given time.i52 In this sense, the cinematic illusion is based not—as is often assumed—-on a passivity but on a certain activity on the part of the viewer. And whereas the activity of forming interrelations in conventional narrative cinema tends to remain in service of the story and is thus kept in latency, Douglas's anti-illusionist practice heightens this formation in ways that ultimately aims to transform it into a qualitatively different, self-reflective, performative, productivity: into an aesthetic experience.  

Very quickly—-even as the action recurs for the first time—-we are no longer certain what we actually saw earlier. Is this a new sequence or simply deja vu? Where does a new sequence begin and where does it end? Win, Place or Show creates a dreamlike effect in actu. Whereas Yonemoto's installation gives rise to a tension between the two times of the machine (the represented time of the lilies and the time of the loop) and the time of aesthetic experience, Douglas's installation dissolves our sense of the time of the video (six minutes per repetition)—and hence also of the time of the action presented in variations--into the indefinite time of aesthetic experience. It becomes increasingly difficult to recognize the varying repetitions as such; the different variations of the fight become increasingly a single endless fight, which nonetheless never consolidates into a narrative but time and again falls apart into its individual elements. The individual shot becomes independent of its possible narrative context without, however, ever quite being able to move beyond this horizon. Because the viewer's active creation of interrelations can obviously not be brought to rest in some narrative meaning, a tension will inevitably arise also between the fundamentally limited time of his stay in the installation and the, in principle, unlimited time of aesthetic experience. There is no objective end to this experience. We can only put an arbitrary end to it by leaving the installation and ceasing to think of it.  

Duration/hyper slow motion. The spectator is confronted with the time of his own experience in relation to the time of the video or film in a different way than in looping when the moving image approximates the unmoving image. In the case of so-called duration pieces, an almost unchanging object is recorded over a fairly long time. Examples from the world of experimental film would be Andy Warhol's eight-hour film Empire (1964), which shows a static shot of the Empire State Building, and his film Sleep (1963), itself six hours long, which presents different shots of a sleeping man each of which is repeated again and again. In the case of so-called hyper slow motion, the movement of a filmed object is slowed down by technical means such that the image barely changes-—-that is, it changes only very slowly. Examples include Bill Viola's The Quintet of the Unseen (2000) and Douglas Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho (1992). Gordon uses video technology to stretch a screening of Alfred  

Hitchcock's Psvcho to twenty-four hours, not only removing the original sound but also suspending all suspense: the classic movie dissolves into a succession of individual images. Bill Viola's video work The Quintet of the Unseen. presented on a wall-mounted fat screen, shows five people in a theatrical arrangement, a kind of tableau vivant. All five barely change their facial expressions (duration), and these minuscule changes are moreover extremely slowed down by technical means (hyper slow motion). Viola's work, perched between film still, tableau vivant, and portraiture—-its presentation on the wall being an obvious allusion to the traditional painted paneldemonstrates perhaps most clearly that both duration and hyper slow motion, as well as their combination, take the tendency implicit in the time-based arts toward spatialization to its utmost consequence. The film or video images tend to appear as a succession of individual images (Gordon) or as variations on one unmoving image (Viola).  

Still, such procedures will not give rise to any serious insecurity on the part of the viewer about whether he is regarding a moving or an unmoving image, as Boris Groys thinks.153 On the contrary, the point of these works is in part that they emphasize the very fundamental difference between the moving and the unmoving image precisely by their mutual rapprochement. Any pointed gaze that lasts longer than the blink of an eye will register this difference in the small changes of the moving image, no matter how slowly it is moving. The elements of the film or video image-unlike the elements of a painted panel —-are subject to change in time. Bringing them closer to the spatiality of the unmoving image inevitably entails a gesture back toward the temporality of filmic representation. Only to a very superficial behoider, then, will the duration piece seem to permit a viewing "complete and clear” enough that it makes no appreciable difference if we temporarily leave the installation. Drastic changes do indeed contradict not only the principle of duration, but in a certain way also that of hyper slow motion. (This is so even in the case of Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho, which is about stretching a source material that the general viewer is assumed to be familiar with.) But the concept of what drastic change can mean in relation to filmic material gradually changes in the course of our viewing. Precisely because change is reduced and/or slowed down, even the tiniest changes become potentially significant; the mere fact of change gains an enormous dramatic quality by virtue of the procedures of hyper slow motion and duration. We stand spellbound, but not because we are tracing a plot the work represents--and be it even as suspenseful as that of Hitchcock's Psycho-but because we are observing the smallest changes in time of an otherwise relatively static representation.  

When a cinematic installation employs the procedures of duration and hyper slow motion, seeing the work in its entirety is not the primary point. Such work is in most cases either already so long or so inconspicuously looped that capturing and/or questioning the temporal unity of such a work in the framework of the temporal economy of a visit to the museum cannot be our first interest. Unlike in the cinema, where similar works may well be about the imposition of their duration on the viewer, in the installation format they are about the imposition that the viewer must determine their duration for himself. But unlike with repetitive-loop works, whose point is in part that the indefinite experience of the viewer is confronted with an infinitely repeated material that permits a more or less “complete viewing," the viewer cannot really anticipate the end of a duration or hyper slow motion work. Once he leaves such an installation, he does in fact miss something-—further changes, however minimal, the film image undergoes over time. This interplay between filmic material and open form of presentation is obviously not so much about my perception of the internal temporality of my aesthetic experience vis- $\dot{\boldsymbol{a}}$ -vis the temporality of the work but rather about a reflection on the temporal constitution of the work within the time of that experience.  

I have discussed both repetitive loop and duration/hyper slow motion in part as devices that more or less explicitly labor against the ideal of a synchronization of the viewer's time with that of the film or video, thus opening up the respective materials to an aesthetic experience. But my arguments against a conception of aesthetic experience based on an aesthetics of presentness, here laid out on the example of artistic developments in and between various aesthetic media, should not be mistaken, in particular in the context of a discussion of film, as arguments in favor of a \*distracted attention"--at least not if \*distraction" is understood in Benjamin's sense.  

For what Benjamin's "reception in a state of distraction" has in common with the reception in perpetual presentness is the annulment of the aesthetic distance between receiving subject and aesthetic object. It is indicative that architecture, even more than film, is the paradigmatic object of what Benjamin describes as reception-in-distraction. The reception of architecture, like the subsequent reception of film—due to the physical, tactile shock effect caused by its succession of images-—is marked, according to Benjamin, not only by optical perception, but also by tactile use. And the dimension of the tactile, of unmediated use, even defines the role distracted reception plays for the new social function of art: \*such reception,” Benjamin writes,  

cannot be understood in terms of the concentrated attention of a traveler before a famous building. On the tactile side, there is no counterpart to what contemplation is on the optical side. Tactile reception comes about not so much by way of attention as by way of habit. [...J Under certain circumstances, this form of reception shaped by architecture acquires canonical value. For the tasks which face the human apparatus of perception at historical turning points cannot be performed solely by optical means-that is, by way of contemplation. They are mastered gradually--taking their cue from tactile reception-through habit.(WA, 120-21)  

As Jonathan Crary has demonstrated, there is no type of attention that is in itself aesthetic. Neither concentrated nor distracted perception is limited to the field of the aesthetic; both are, in fact, fixed components of respective "disciplinary regimes." This much is indicated, albeit with an inverse distribution of value, in Benjamin's hopes for the historically new function of film. Contrary to Crary, the fact that there is no type of attention that is in itself aesthetic does not imply that the difference between aesthetic and non-aesthetic perception or experience is invalid or irrelevant.1s4 For aesthetic experience, as should have become clear, cannot be correctly described either as a self-presence of the focused spectator in the theater who discerns his ethical reflection in the presentness of the dramatic events, or as the reduction of that viewer to a passive, habit-forming automatism in the cinema. What makes these two descriptions so similar is precisely the annulment of the subject's aesthetic distance from the object. That is why Cavell's reflections on theater systematicaily converge with those on cinema in the motivation behind such an annulment---and we need not discuss here whether his theory does more justice to cinema, with its particular illusionist potential, than to theater. What is at stake in the present context are the concepts of art and aesthetic experience, concepts whose specificity, I think, is systematically lost when aesthetic distance is annulledwhatever moral uprightness or cultural-political revolutionary spirit maymotivate such annulment.  

Against the motivations of this annulment in Cavell and Fried, aesthetic distance, as I have already shown in part 1, must not be mistaken for the distance of an asymmetrical relationship in which the subject exercises command over the object. One can speak of aesthetic distance only when the subject's hermeneutic approach to the object is blocked in a specifically aesthetic way, that is, by virtue of an irreducible tension between what is representing and what is represented. Because the subject's hermeneutic approach to the aesthetic object is thus fundamentally unsettled, the subject will refect on its own productivity in the creation of interrelations on/within the object. This self-reflective performativity of the aesthetic experience can obviously not be described correctly either in terms of a (however focused) subject reconstructing or mentally duplicating the construction of an objectivity of the work said to be “present” as such, nor in terms of a (however distracted) habituation to the work's objective effects. From the perspective of a theory of aesthetic experience of the sort I propose here, concentration and distraction conceived in such fashion would seem to be merely two modes of non-aesthetic reception. The artwork is indeed generally submerged in theoretical "waves” (WA, 119) whenever the aesthetic distance between subject and object that arises in communication with the object is annulled  

Or sublated: be it in the false "presentness" of an object reified into a quasi-subject, as in Fried, Cavell, and Adorno (as we will soon see once again and more precisely in an analysis of a few of the latter's music-philosophical theses); or be it because the aesthetic object is put to the service of cultural politics, as in Benjamin.  

If the concept against an ethics of aesthetic attention and that against a cultural politics of aesthetic distraction is here dubbed "aesthetic experience," it should nonetheless not be confused with either the notion of "composed recollection," which serves to confirm the bourgeois ideal of introspective profundity, nor with that of "contemplation." used nearly synonymously by Benjamin. Both terms not only seem obsolete today, as Benjamin already rightly noted, but have also led to a systematic confusion--above all when they were used as synonyms. I have already noted in previous chapters, and should like to repeat once more in the present context in order to avoid any misunderstanding, that the subject of aesthetic experience by no means exercises complete control over its self-reflective and performative activity. The subject experiences itself as performative or productive in its relation with the aesthetic object, but the powers at work in it are incapable of being objectified or even controlled. In this sense, a concentrated focus on specific details and the "distraction" effected by other details that may unexpectedly "gaze at" or otherwise “confront the receiving subject-that is, concentration and distraction-— are two equally constitutive components of aesthetic experience.  

My argument up to this point should have made clear that cinematographic installation, given its anti-illusionist potential, among other aspects, very much lends itself to such an experience. At any rate, its widespread and rapid appearance on the stage of contemporary art is not, as the art critic Benjamin Buchloh put it in reaction to the 2001 Venice Biennale, drawing on Walter Benjamin's terminolOgy, a symptom of the displacement of exhibition value by a new kind of "spectacle value. "Exhibition value,”" writes Buchloh, "the condition of the secularized modernist work as fully emancipated from cult value and myth--has been replaced by spectacle value, a condition in which media control in everyday life is mimetically internalized and aggressively extended into those visual practices that had previously been defined as either exempt from or oppositional to mass-cultural regimes."ss We will leave aside the question of whether Debord's concept of the spectacle has a reliable explanatory force for an analysis of mass culture today beyond the suggestion of cultural decline it implies: even in Benjamin, exhibition value is, as we have seen, not merely the condition of a completely secularized and historically autonomous art. It is, in Benjamin, simultaneously the first symptom of a profound shift in the function of art: art, Benjamin expects, will not only become mass culture but will likewise also take on the function that Buchloh trusts only an art under the sign of “spectacle value” capable of fulfilling—to train people, to adapt them to the social realities. This happens, however, with an inverted distribution of value: Buchloh's diagnosis is one of cultural decline, not of a pre-revolutionary situation. But neither film nor the cinematographic installation can in itself be taken to represent such a “shift" in the “function" of art-—-which would be tantamount to its abolition. On the contrary, like experimental, “art house,”" or great Hollywood film, cinematographic installation, as I hope to have shown, has the potential to become the object of an experience in which various technological and media conditions break free from, and become immune to, their subjection to any ideological functionit has the potential to be art.  

Cinematographic installation, as Gertrude Stein's theater and the "theatrical" installation discussed previously, demonstrates that this concept of art is tied to a concept of aesthetic experience according to which the vestigially metaphysical idea of a synchronization between this experience and the course of the filmic or dramatic plot is precisely mistaken. For this idea of a synchronicity between aesthetic experience and the temporal process of the various time-based arts corresponds to an objectivistic conception of art against which many forms of installation art, not only those I have discussed so far, labor implicitly or explicitly. The tension between the time of aesthetic experience and that of the temporal process of the concrete work of art has been an object of musical production at least since the late  

sixties. Even more clearly than cinematographic installation, sound installation seems to have originated in an avant-gardist engagement of precisely this problem. That is why I will conclude my reflections on the interrelations between the trends toward spatialization in time-based arts and the spatial art of installation with an examination of sound installation.  

# 2.3. Sound Installation .4. (Theodor W. Adorno, Stanley Cavell)  

In his essay on King Lear, Stanley Cavell introduces the idea of "continuous presentness" via a small excursion into the realm of musical perception. The experience of tonal music-—-like that of dramatic theater-is inseparable, according to Cavell, from a certain unpredictability of its progression, which nonetheless pursues a pointed course. The audience is thus kept in a state of continually present attention for each individual moment of the process.156 Like Cavell's concept of aesthetic experience grounded in an aesthetics of presentness, the one Adorno develops in his music-philosophical writings is based on the ideal listener who reconstructs the music in an attentive and present mind, sublating the time of the aesthetic experience into that of the time-based art of music. And even more pronounced than by Cavell, Adorno sees this ideal, and therefore his conception of music (that is, of music as art), threatened by the then-recent developments in music, particularly the rising trend toward its spatialization.157  

With a view to musical developments after 1945---to works by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, and John CageAdorno writes in his 1961 essay entitled "Vers une musique informelle":  

Nevertheless, my reactions to most of these works is qualitatively different from my reaction to the whole tradition down to, and doubtless including, Webern's last works. My productive imagination does not reconstruct them all with equal success. I am not able to participate, as it were, in the process of composing them as I listen, as I still could with Webern's String Trio, which is anything but a simple piece. But what I am tempted at first to register as my own subjective inadequacy may turn out not to be that at all. It may well prove to be the case that serial and postserial music is founded on a quite different mode of apperception, in so far as music can be said to be based on apperception at all. In traditional listening the music unfolds from the parts to the whole, in tune with the flow of time itself. This flowthat is to say, the parallel between the temporal succession of musical events and the pure flow of time itself-has become problematical and presents itself within the work as a task to be thought through and mastered. (VMI, 271)  

According to Adorno, this task can be “mastered” only by a music that subscribes neither to the ideal of the organic, like, exemplarily, that of Wagner, nor to the belief in the pure material, like that of John Cage. Whereas Wagner produces a semblance of a virtually natural organicism through half steps that effortlessly flow into one another, thereby concealing its construction——-the fact that this music is made (VMI, 306--7)-—-Cage's musical positivism, according to Adorno, outdoes itself by eliminating not only the semblance of the organic but the entire idea of musical construction made by subjects. What replaces such construction here are tonal relations governed exclusively by ostensibly objective relations whose foundation is either "esoteric” (Cage) or “"mathematical" (writing in 1961, Adorno may also be thinking of Iannis Xenakis).1ss Although Adorno shares the critique of the organic work of art, he cannot accept such radicalism. For something else is given with the principle of thorough compositional organization, something that is for Adorno an essential part of the concept of music: the idea of temporal dynamism in musical  

coherence. The temporal sequence, the interrelations between subsequent sounds seems, for Adorno, to remain external to these sounds in works that are merely calculated; they appear in unconnected juxtaposition and hence tend toward the static. "For preference they would like to do away." Adorno writes about the composers leading the most recent developments of his time,  

with everything covered by the term "tendency” in musical peinture, that is to say the idea that a musical expression left to itself would like to proceed to the next and go on from there.  

This may well explain the overall static complexion: the image of a music essentially alien to time. It attempts to make do without strong categories. But, against its own intentions, this just deprives it of objectivity and makes it incompatible with the medium of time to which as music it inevitably belongs. To neglect time means nothing less than that music is failing to concern itself with one of its specific material preconditions. (VMI, 310) "But in music,” Adorno writes programmatically, nothing has the right to follow something else unless it has been determined by what precedes it or conversely, unless it reveals $e x$ post facto that what has preceded it was, in reality, its own precondition.  

For otherwise the concrete temporal unity of music and its abstract temporal form will break asunder. What demands to appear just now, neither sooner nor later, feeds parasitically on time, since it automatically enters the chain of succession. If a musique informelle is expected to absorb thematic, motivic composition into itself, despite its rejection of it, this only means that music should resolve the dilemma of how to reconcile temporal form and musical content. (VMI, 297)  

For Adorno, the relation between musical "contents" and musical "form'--that is, in Adorno, between the "musical individual shapes' and their “integration in time'is9—-makes all the difference, that is, the difference between music and mere sound material, between art and objecthood.160 Yet, according to Adorno, only composition can safeguard this relation in music. Only composition, or more precisely, the synthesis achieved by the composer in establishing a dynamic interrelation between directly or indirectly subsequent elements, can, for Adorno, liberate the sound material into the “process of a growing unity between parts and whole" that is more than a mere “subsumption of the details" (VMI, 307). Precisely "if the musical substance is to develop organically,” he concludes, “the intervention of the subject is required, or rather, the subject must become an integral part of the organism, something which the organism itself calls for. If appearances do not deceive, it is upon this that the future of music depends" (VMI, 307). With respect to an informal music, liberated from the musicallinguistic idioms of tonal relations in the broadest sense, this cannot but entail, for Adorno, that thematic work, which safeguarded musical coherence in traditional music, must be replaced by work on succession. The latter, Adorno writes, “must perform what was once done by thematic work, even if its methods-—-identity, variations, surface connections between motifs-are ruthlessly cut away" (VMI, 314).  

Such a work on succession, however, like thematic work, is possible only, according to Adorno, in and by virtue of the fixed image of written music——the score. \*The complex forms by means of which succession is internally organized as such would be inadequate for any improvised, non-written music-making” (VMI, 295). Elsewhere, he writes even more explicitly: "Without writing [...] [there is] no highly organized music; the historical distinction between improvisation and musica composita coincides qualitatively with that between laxness and musical articulation" (RMP, 70). If we leave aside the enormous aesthetic ignorance implicit in the rejection of all improvised music as lax-as many critics have noted, it defines Adorno's failure to engage jazz—-what this rejection once again reveals is Adorno's notion of the musical work of art. For compositional construction is no less than the very heart of this work. Only on the basis of the score, the compositional construction fixed in writing, claims Adorno, can music be constituted as a time-based art in the emphatic sense; only here does musical time proper take shape. For only here is each of its elements given a specific function in the musical totality. Only by virtue of the compositional production of such totality can music transcend the empirical time in which it unfolds—-to become art.  

Yet the fact that the score assumes such a central role for Adorno implies by no means that the musical work must merely be made audible as the objectively complete work of art as that which already exists in the score. Even Schoenberg's meticulously detailed modern scores, as Adorno notes elsewhere, are not so unambiguous as to render interpretation unnecessary.161 Only critical interpretation can render musical synthesis concealed beneath written notes and simple tempo indications visible, as well as, subsequently, audible. Accordingly, Adorno uses a visual metaphor to describe the analytical interpretation of the written score required for a successful performance. The "true interpretation," Adorno writes, in conveying insight into structure of the musical phenomenon resembles an $^{\circ\circ}\mathrm{x}$ -rayimage of the text.\*'162 The fact that such interpretations are themselves historically mutable does of course not in itself justify to Adorno's mind an interpretive relativism. For interpretation must meet the same demands in relation to its text that composition faces in relation to its material. Just as composition must not indulge in a belief in the pure material nor, on the other hand, circumvent the problem of musical coherence through a recourse to traditional solutions,163 interpretation must not simply abide, in positivistic fashion, by “what the score reads,” nor simply adopt traditional interpretive suggestions. Musical interpretation, then, also exists under the demands of aesthetic progress; the latter being understood in this case as progress within the understanding of the structure of the musical work-as “progress in [its] transparency."164 Such progress, however—-just like the progress of aesthetic production --can be achieved only on the basis of the "most advanced state of composition-technical insight, and thus [of] compositional technique itself."“For it is [..] the unfolding of the means of [(partial) musical totality], that the light which reveals ever-renewed contexts shines upon the texts."165  

The ideal of an interpretation based on the most advanced insight into compositional technique aims at as precise an articulation as possible of all individual musical events such that the latter become manifest in their function in the musical context as a temporal dynamic. Generating this coherence—finding the “central thread of succession?16—-according to Adorno, should be the goal of the critical immersion in the text. He leaves no doubt that he considers such an exegesis of the text, directed toward its temporal-dynamic coherence, as an indispensable prerequisite for a successful realization of the sound material of a musical work. “"The quality of the performance does not mean that there will be more or less musical meaning,\* Adorno writes in this context; “"rather, there will be a qualitative  

rupture: if the meaning is not wholly realized, if every aspect of the work is not related to it and bearing its stamp, then, in critical cases, all will be lost."167 The interpretation, which pursues the “central thread of succession" in the musical totality, is, for Adorno, not only a requirement for any adequate performance of a work, but simultaneously also a prerequisite for the work to be "understood" by the audience. This understanding, however, also requires an aesthetically educated audience. The work composed at the most advanced level of compositional technique and then interpreted accordingly seeks an appropriately—that is, sufficiently—-advanced ear.  

Such an ear dwells precisely not-and this, according to how I understand Adorno and Cavell, fundamentally distinguishes the former's critical from the latter's empathetic ear—-on every "now" of the musical event but, as it were, listens through this now to hear the "central thread" of the musical process. It hears the musical meaning that transcends empirical time and in so doing constitutes the musical time proper. the time-based art. \*The more completely the musical meaning is present in the appearance,” Adorno writes, "the less that appearance is mere presence——-or put more drastically: the more completely it is polarized according to its temporal horizon, its protentionality and retentionality, and the less it exhausts itself in the moment of its mere existence."168 For Adorno, to hear means to hear construction, to participate in the composition by creating interrelations that reach forward and backward in time. The aesthetic experience according to Adorno is thus synchronous not in fact with the process of the musical work in empirical time but, as it were, with that which is musically represented in this time: with what Adorno calls "'musical meaning." Still, this too, I think, is an ideal of synchronicity between work and receiving subject, albeit perhaps a second-order synchronicity.  

For in the musical work of art, that is, where there is musical coherence or meaning, "the \*mathematical’ time recognized in its quasispatialized objectivity tends to coincide with the lived experience of time."169 This means nothing other than empirically measurable time ought to be sublated by virtue of the compositional-interpretive achievement in the musical coherence. Yet, according to Adorno's historico-philosophical argument, given the “real diremption of subject and object,"170 such a mediation of the subjective time of experience with objective time can succeed only under precisely defined conditions: when the technical "productive force” of the empirical composer or interpreting performer, by virtue of a critical self-transcendence of the command that compositional technique exercises over the material, becomes subservient to the latteri71 and, as it were, abandons itself to an experience of the non-identical in the material.172 Then, however-—and that is to say, under the conditions of aesthetic progress-the subjective productive force of the composer or performer is endowed with a universality that, for Adorno, transcends this force. It constitutes a musical meaning that is as different "from projections which are purely subjective” as from “thing-like objectifications" (VMI, 321). What thus emerges, Adorno writes in the Philosophy of New Music, is \*"a musical subject-object"173—-that is, the second objectivity of autonomous art.  

Regardless of what one thinks of the potentially mystifying image of a kind of production that, as it were, interpassively follows the "mimetic impulses" of the material, the actual problem--as we have already established in our discussion of Adorno's dialectical construction of aesthetic spirit174 --concerns Adorno's claim that the  

mediation thus conceived between construction and material, between the time of subjective experience and objective \*mathematical' time, can be objectified in \*musical meaning,"175 such that the latter \*would legitimate itself in terms of its adequacy to its own material if the most progressive ears could respond to it at every moment as if it answered their own desires" (VMI, 321). Yet a critique of this connection concerns the core of Adorno's aesthetic theory. For it is here that what Adorno describes as the second objectivity of the work of art- which must be strictly distinguished from objecthoodis constituted: it is not, like the commodity, for the listener but it stands, like a subject, on its own. "The concept of the musical subject," Adorno writes, "should be differentiated. It has absolutely nothing to do with potential listeners, and everything to do with the human right to what Hegel termed \*being present [Dabeisein]. It is the right of subjectivity to be present in the music itself, as the power of its immediate performance' (VMI, 320). This idea of musical experience as being present to, participating in, reconstructing, and acknowledging the quasi-subjectivity that--according to Adorno and Cavell176-—- is the autonomous (time-based) artwork, is problematic not, for instance, because of the elitism implied in the idea of the aesthetically advanced audience. I do not think that Adorno's arguments for an aesthetic (including production-aesthetic) education of the audience pose a problem in and of themselves.177 His conception of musical experience is problematic rather because it reduces an aesthetic experience to participation in the construction or reconstruction of a particular structural relationship that is ultimately read directly from the score. Yet how the musical work of art is made and it is for good reasons that this is a fundamental problem in music scholarship-is not the same as what it is.  

Adorno was quite right to object to the fetishization of the individual note in the ideology of musical positivism ("Ce n'est pas le ton qui fait la musique" [VMI, 299]), and to point out that the individual note in its musical context is always more than merely just that, and is only perceived in such a context—in a relationally constituted musical "configuration [Gestalt]" (VMI, 299). But the creation of musical coherence as it takes place in composition and interpretation is structurally different from the creation of coherence accomplished on the part of aesthetic experience. For the latter is in fact irreducible to the understanding of certain structural relations that, according to Adorno, are simultaneously its meaning. Just as it would be an aesthetic mistake, as we have seen in the case of dramatic theater or film, to reduce the experience of such works to a mental reconstruction of the dramatic events, it would be an aesthetic mistake, in the case of music, to reduce the experience of it to a participation in the construction, or a reconstruction, of formally comprehensible structural relations. In both cases, what is effaced from the phenomena is what constitutes them as aesthetic in the first place: the tension between what is representing and what is represented. This marginalizes, in the case of dramatic theater, the dimension of representation, and in the case of music, its latent relation to the world. Yet the tension between what is representing and what is represented is constitutive of all aesthetic experience. Accordingly, we ought not to identify, as Adorno does, musical meaning with structural coherence (the latter ought not be charged as such with content). Instead, given the fundamentally irresolvable tension between what is representing and what is represented, the musical work of art, too, creates an open horizon of possible formations of interrelation and hence also of meaning, including meanings relating the work to the world. These formations, however, and this is decisive here, cannot terminate in a constellation of the whole and its parts, be it that this constellation is defined in formal terms or with regard to ameaning.178  

From this perspective, Adorno's (and Cavell's) idea of the listener obliged to “ubiquitous immediacy, permanent presence” (VMI, 283) must seem problematic as well, and not only because the authoritarian tendency implicit in it.179 For this obligation, according to Adorno, does not brook any "ego-weakness" of the kind that he --again not unlike Cavell-- believes he recognizes as the driving motive behind Cage's aleatory practices (see VMl, 283). This idea is problematic more importantly because musical elements may fulfill a variety of functions in the temporally forward and backward reaching interrelations created in aesthetic experience. For the receiving subject (at least of an aesthetic experience) there is no single musical coherence that would perfectly define every moment of the work. This means, however, that not all elements of a musical work of art can be equally "present" to the listener. In this context, a remark by the composer Herbert Eimert. cited by Adorno as an example of the positivist belief in the material, might take on a different meaning. "The notes,\* Adorno writes. quoting Eimert, "do not function, they exist. Not that psychology in music is to give way to physics. The sums don't work out as neatly as that. The acoustic process is the product of the intercourse between perception and the state of the object" (VMI, 285). Eimert, unlike Adorno, does not reduce the musical elements-- notes and sounds-—to their position in functional interrelation. Nor, however--and it is indicative that Adorno would fail to note this-- does he reduce them to their physical natural qualities. They attain their possible meaning(s) for the “acoustic process,” the musical work, only in the “intercourse between perception and the state of the object." Art, as we have argued, can generally not be objectified independently of the performative perspective of the subjects of aesthetic experience. But the constitutive role aesthetic experience plays for the concept of the work of art, once again, by no means implies that the aesthetic object is “surrendered” to the subject. Because of the indefinite structure of the aesthetic experience, its resistance to closure, and because of the constitutive unsettling of the hermeneutic approach to the aesthetic object that is constitutive of this experience, it instead entails a specific aesthetic opening of the subject-object relationship.  

Now, the interminability of aesthetic experience implies, in the case of the time-based art of music, a structural tension between the time of the empirical process and that of aesthetic experience. For the processuality of the aesthetic experience cannot be objectifiedas an aesthetics of the work, or of production, would have it—-in terms of time as organized by a piece of music. The extent to which the processuality of the time-based art of music is paradigmatic for Adorno's concept of the processuality of aesthetic experience in general, is particularly evident when, in the Philosophy of New Music, he disparages painting because it is not endowed with the processuality of time-based art."All painting,” he writes, “even the most abstract, has its pathos in what emphatically is; all music presupposes a becoming."180 But all art is processual--contrary to Adorno's interpretation of aesthetic processuality—-because the relations in the work, its coherence, can never be conclusively evident to the subject of an aesthetic experience of it. This, if anything, emancipates the elements of the work of art into a process in which they may develop productive as well as destructive impulses with respect to any particular context in which they are placed. Yet with regards to the musical work of art, this means that its temporal process, however dynamic it may be, ought not to be identified with the processuality of aesthetic experience itself. The time of aesthetic experience can hence also not coincide with that of the work--unlike the latter, the former is indefinite due to the, in principle, infinite possible interrelations of form and meaning. "Musical time,” conceived as genuinely aesthetic time, is not identical to the objective time of its chronometric duration; nor, however, can it be confined to a coherent formal structure. It is unleashed, time and again, in the subjective processes of aesthetic experience. If this is correct, if aesthetic processuality is internally tied to the perspective of aesthetic experience, and if the latter should therefore also not be confused with the sequentiality of musical elements in time, no matter how dynamic the latter is conceived, then Adorno's preference for a certain type of music that unfolds dynamically in time can no longer be an issue of decisive importance to the question of the autonomy of art. Instead, the fact that Adorno elevates this preference to a matter of philosophical principle reveals an objectivist idea not only of aesthetic experience, but ipso facto also of the musical work of art.  

In music as in the other arts, anti-objectivist insight into the constitutive role that the subject of aesthetic experience plays for art in general has been reflected in a particularly conspicuous way in a wide variety of productions since the sixties. Yet the same insight, I would argue, already underlies the modern tendency toward spatialization in music: in analogy to the tendencies toward spatialization in the other time-based arts, time, which no longer appears as a mere derivative of musical dynamism, increasingly emerges in the dimension of representation by virtue of spatializing tendencies. The reduction of what occurs in music (repetitive loops and subtle variations, the atomization of sounds vis-a-vis construction, of intervals visa-vis the transitions between them, and of rhythm vis-a-vis melody) in short, everything that to Adorno's mind constitutes the parasitical\* relation to time in evidence in works being produced contemporaneously--allow for a reflection on time as, among other things, a musical means of representation. Yet, since this reflection will take place in the indefinite and structurally anti-teleological time of aesthetic experience, this will inevitably bring the structural incongruence between the temporal development of the music and the internal time of its experience to the fore. Counter to the objectivist idea of a musical subjectivity that objectifies itself in the construction of "musical time” and “"would legitimate itself in terms of its adequacy to its own material if the most progressive ears could respond to it at every moment as if it answered their own desires,” the tendency toward spatialization attests to an idea of music that does away not only with the obligatory subjective expression but explicitly also with the objectivist idea of a coincidence of the temporal course of the works and the time of subjective experience. And it does so in favor of an explicit musical “objecthood,” whose autonomy from and contradistinction to the world of objects is based not in its mere form  

but in its dynamization in a particular form of experience. “There is a   
line of development in modern music,”' as Albrecht Wellmer has noted, which links Debussy with Stravinsky, Messiaen, and Ligeti. It is a line of development that Adorno, who was preoccupied with the German-Austrian tradition of dynamic, expressive constructivism, never really came to terms with. [...] It is characteristic of the music of the other tradition, however, that there we do not find, in Hegel's terms, the "sphere of subjective inwardness," externalizing itself in sound, but that things themselves are given acoustic expression, that the world is transformed into a realm of sound. By contrast with the finality of a subject-centered temporality, the color, rhythmic complexity, and spatiality of music are foregrounded in an object-like form that is no longer final.181  

And some aspects, such as the astonishingly consistent privileging of sound, sonic surfaces. and rhythm in relation to notes, pitches, and melodies in twentieth-century music from musique concrete to free jazz to ambient and minimalist techno, even suggest that for the concept of aesthetic modernity we should ultimately consider this line to be the more influential tradition.182  

At any rate, what Adorno castigates as the “pseudomorphosis toward painting” (RMP, 67), namely the tendency, which has been increasingly self-propelled since Debussy, to emancipate sound via construction, is in no way a sign of a reversal of art into objecthood or spiritlessness or “crass infantilism' (see RMP, 68), as Adorno judges on the basis of fundamental philosophical decisions. In "On Some Relationships between Music and Painting,” Adorno writes (and we can certainly agree): ^“If painting or music were simply lacking the expressive element. the element of an expression without anything concrete to be expressed, the work would no longer intend toward something that is not its own phenomenon and that cannot be hidden in symbolic unity, either within it or anywhere outside it. The work would regress $[\dots]$ to a preartistic state; it would no longer crackle with electricity" (RMP, 72). The fact, however, that such a representational potential of sonic material need not be tied to any particular, say, expressive-dynamic method of organization, as Adoino believed because of the premises we have discussed, is evident even more clearly than in the tendency toward spatialization in music precisely where, from Adorno's perspective, it would be impossible and probably indeed misleading to speak of music at all: in sound installation.  

![images/8b85b4e24a9e72c9a9cb87e01cd80e459c760e738e4abf7c7aff99a333c7bbbf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/u2CiQ08.jpeg)  

In sound installation, there is usually no musical construction that could be "composed along while listening” because there is neither a composition nor a performance nor even the reproduction of one: there is only sound in space. And this sound knows neither beginning nor end and hence no dynamism and no dramaturgy of development. Of course, sound installations inevitably present themselves as events in time, and refectively exhibit time by virtue of the extreme reduction of what happens within it as well as-—- and in this they resemble the cinematographic installation——-their open temporal structure, that is, the unspecified duration of the visitor's stay in the installation. But the sound installation, driving the tendencies toward spatialization in music to an extreme, is not so much about the temporal dimension of the acoustic event but rather about its spatial dimension. It thus fulfills all the criteria that define, in Adorno's mind, an art sliding into pre-artisticness, spiritlessness, objecthood.  

Whereas Adorno defines the necessary relation of music to space against these tendencies primarily on the basis of the relationship between music and notation, which he presumes to be constitutive of the former (see RMP, 69-70), sound installation, a hybrid situated between visual art and music, is obviously about something else: the constitutive relation of the acoustic phenomenon to space. Not only do acoustic phenomena necessarily unfold in space, they can also move in space, articulating the space in which we find ourselves, sensitizing us to it; conversely, however, space in many ways also determines the acoustic phenomenon, (co)creating it or transforming it. The fact that spatial conditions can thus become an integral part of the acoustic phenomenon is of course a matter of interest not only in sound installation but was already of importance to those compositional experiments of the early sixties that had been the subject of Adorno's concern for the “future of music."183 This relation has been engaged with regard both to the discovery of space as resonating space184 and to the acoustic articulation of spaces, or more generally, of environments; and the latter in turn in two respects: concerning the creation of acoustic spatial atmospheres, and in a reflection on the acoustic "spaces" or "landscapes" that surround us every day. Today, both respects can be associated with the term “ambient." It refers, on the one hand, to music explicitly dedicated to the creation of an acousticatmospheric background for a particular spatial mise-en-scene. This aspiration calls to mind--the association is probably not unfair—-the genres of acoustic environmental design derided as elevator music, sound carpets, or Muzak, which aim at a reception of a kind that seems to fit quite well with Benjamin's concept of reception-in-distraction, especially keeping in mind the aspect of passive acclimatization, and which we would therefore no longer call aesthetic. On the other hand, however. as Diedrich Diederichsen has pointed out, ambient may sometimes refer to an \*engagement with the background that is always already there--be it 'natural′ or ' cultural in character."1s What might initially seem to be a contradiction in terms is resolved if we comprehend both aspects in an aesthetically ambitious conception Of ambient as follows: \*If ambient," Diederichsen writes, "means to design music so that it remains in the background on the one hand and turns the already-existing background--environmental sounds and acoustic byproducts-—-into the foreground on the other, then the concept is rooted in a dialectical play with the fact that what is open and pure atmosphere or mood draws exactly on the getting-out-ofhand and becoming-unfamiliar of that which is something in a very precise sense, namely. an everyday sound."186 As the introduction to a sound art anthology notes programmatically: "Noise—-your lover's voice, a factory foor, the television news--is ripe with meaning and content distinguishable from the meaning and content of musical expression. It is this content that constitutes any possibility of an art of sound."187 Sounds have meaning in multiple ways--unlike the medium of music, they are related to the world in a quite direct way. Yet as John Cage has exemplarily shown,188 even the everyday sound, as an aesthetic phenomenon, is irreducible to its denotative function-—-it gets “out of hand" in a specifically aesthetic way, becoming sound, atmosphere, or mood, white noise. An aesthetic experience of the acoustic material can neither sublate it in a particular meaning nor grasp it as such, as \*'mere being." Material and meaning, as we have already seen in the example of the presumed objecthood of Minimal art, exist only in dynamic-conflictual interrelation in the aesthetic experience.  

Like ambient music, the sound installation is constituted as an acoustic phenomenon in the “dialectic of meaningless meaningfulness and meaningful meaninglessness.'189 But what is specific to sound installation is that this dialectic does not, or at least not primarily, refer to the acoustic-musical phenomenon itself but occurs between the sound and the concrete space in which it is installed, that is, exhibited. The concrete space may indeed also take on an important aesthetic function for the performance of such work, but it is of particular aesthetic significance in the installation because, as I have said, there is no performance: there is only the occurrence of sound in space. The sound lends atmosphere to the space, furnishes it with an acoustic background—-as, conversely, the space exhibits the sound, moves it to the foreground, enables us in the first place to consciously hear it. It should be noted that the sound can work against the space as well as with it. The sound can acoustically evoke a space quite different from the one in which it is installed (as in Bill Fontana's Harmonic Bridge [2006]), or it can amplify the sounds that may already have existed in the space (as in, for example, certain works by Max Neuhaus, the “inventor” of sound installation). In both cases neither the sound nor the space can be defined as foreground or background. This movement, which continuously shifts the significant object of attention between sound and space, between acoustic and visual phenomenon, is one aspect of the aesthetic potential of sound installation. Many installations heighten this potential by including sound that is altered by the hearer/viewer's own movement within the installation. Unlike all the other types of installations we have discussed so far, many sound installations are indeed interactive. The listener/viewer triggers sounds and/or alters them. Yet the fact that the listener/viewer's movements in space seem to set this space itself in motion, dynamizing space itself in its acoustic as well as its visual representational potential, is an effect not so much of the physical movement of the viewer within it but rather of his selfreflective, performative relation to it.  

Sound installation clearly emerged from the tendencies in music toward spatialization and a growing independence of the sound and, as it were, marks its pinnacle. At the same time, however, sound installation is already about something qualitatively different. It is no longer primarily about a reflection on the representational dimension of time and hence of the time-based art of music in (tense) relation to the internal time of the experience of it. It is instead about a double reflection on space: on the spatial quality of acoustic phenomena On the one hand, and on the acoustic quality of spaces on the other. This is one reason why our discussion of sound installation concludes the present chapter. Because the experience of sound installation aesthetically reflects on the question of whether the particular space is one in which or as which the installation is presented, it once again delineates a particularity of installation art that, as the example of Kabakov's \*total" installation already suggested, is precisely no longer specific to the installational integration or exhibition of timebased arts: the reflection on the representational potential of the space of exhibition or installation.  

To conclude this chapter, we can summarize: there are neither purely spatial arts nor purely time-based arts. On the phenomenological level, time-based arts always contain (at least) one spatial element, even if, as we have seen, they do so in very different ways. And spatial arts are constituted in the processes of aesthetic experience—their internal structure is temporal. Yet we should not conclude from the constitutive processuality of works of art that “essentially all arts are time-based arts, even if they do not successively unfold to perception in time."190 It is true that \*by virtue of the processual interaction of their components [...] in aesthetic perception," the spatial arts evince "a non-linear temporality they share with the arts whose works unfold in time."191 Yet precisely if spatial and time-based arts share a non-linear temporality inherent to them by virtue of their intermal relatedness to the processes of the respective experience of them, we should not, as I hope to have demonstrated in this chapter, identify this temporality with the temporal unfolding of time-based arts. I have shown that the latter does not coincide  

with the former. This is of course particularly manifest in those productions that explicitly make the incongruence between the temporal development of time-based arts and the internal time of the experience of them their subject. The fact that this incongruence has become an important theme in contemporary artistic production in general and of installation art in particular simultaneously distinguishes such art as reflecting a post-metaphysical conception of aesthetic modernity. For it explicitly or implicitly labors against the high modernist ideal of a synchronicity between the temporal development of time-based arts and the internal time proper of the experience of them. Like the ideal of an instantaneous comprehensibility of the work of spatial art, that of a synchronous reconstruction of the work of time-based art is expressive of an aesthetic of presentness and based on an objectivist concept of art. And an opposition to this concept of art is, I believe, the primary motive behind modern tendencies toward the fraying of art genres that, as we have seen, reach their most pointed manifestation in the hybrid art of installation.  

Furthermore, this part has shown that such fraying does not invalidate the discourse on the specific qualities of various aesthetic media; but these qualities do not in themselves prove a solid foundation for aesthetic autonomy or even clearly defined boundaries between art genres. On the contrary, because aesthetic media cannot be “observed”" independently of artistic formal creations, the wide variety of often hybrid works of art today inversely manifest aspects of the respective media that may be as “specific" as they are novel to the concept of these media. This is true also with respect to the light that installation art has shed in sometimes quite literal waysif we think for instance of Dan Flavin's fluorescent light installations-—-on one of the decisive “media conditions” of painting and sculpture: the exhibition space.  

A reflection on the literal sites of art is in most cases tied to a reflection also on its social site. And no form of art has indeed been more explicitly associated with sociopolitical content than that of installation. This association, however, should also be seen in relation to the diminishing significance of the traditional genres for the concept of art. “Under the pressure of an intensifying nominalism,” Adorno writes in his Aesthetic Theory, \*the ever present yet latent social character of art was made increasingly manifest. I... The influx of experiences that are no longer forced into a priori genres, the requirement of constituting form out of these experiences, that is, from below: This is \*realistic' in purely aesthetic terms, regardless of content [Inhalt]. No longer sublimated by the principle of stylization, the relation of content to the society from which it derives at first becomes much less refracted."192 I1n fact, the irruption of the social layer into the level of content already plays an explicit role in all the types of installation I have discussed so far. For beyond the formal-structural problems that have been at issue in the preceding chapters, a significant question for all these works is which sort of semantic content can be brought into the play of aesthetic experience-—-and this is as true for the mute scenes of theatrical installation as it is for the moving images of cinematographic installation or the sounds in sound installation. The next part, entitled \*"Site Specificity, will be dedicated to installation art's reffection on its dual site.  

Yet in closing the present chapter and as a transition to the next, I would first like to return once more to the difference between installation strategies and the tradition of the gesamtkunstwerk. I believe we should distinguish firmly between the installation productions of contemporary art and the ideology of the gesamtkunstwerk not only because that which is aesthetically relevant in them is precisely irreducible to the fiction of a (compulsory) union of all arts, but above all because we should presuppose an aesthetic difference even where, since the historical avant-gardes, the artistic movements themselves have tine and again programmatically and in ever new ways "transgressed'” the boundaries between art and life. Surprisingly enough, the endeavor to suspend the aesthetic difference in fact unites the supporters of the gesamtkunstwerk and the critics of the theatrical. It is not by chance that the festival serves as a paradigm for both the critics of theatricality193 and the ideology of the gesamtkunstwerk.194 In its ambition to defend aesthetic difference against its false sublation into the spectacle of a culture (which is aestheticized in the first place by this sublation), and to do so also and precisely with a view to contemporary art, the present argument deliberately follows Adorno despite the disagreements we have mentioned with respect to the question of how this ought tobe achieved.  

Yet these disagreements imply another theoretical difference: such a defense no longer requires a perspective circumscribed by a philosophy of reconciliation. Unlike Adorno's, my defense of aesthetic difference is no longer put forward in the name of a utopian final reconciliation, and it is thus no longer directed merely against a sublation of art into life, which would be false because it would be inadequate to present historical conditions. Instead, my defense of aesthetic difference is undertaken in the name of a structural autonomy of the aesthetic in relation to the spheres of moral-practical and theoreticalscientific reason; it is thus directed against the idea of a sublation of art into life as such. Though programmatic declarations issued by artistic avant-gardes to this day have often emphasized this idea, transgressive phenomena in art indeed never worked to conclusively transcend art toward life-in fact, that would amount to a self-abolition of art. Rather, such phenomena aim and continue to aim at a particular opening of art toward its concrete historical contexts-—-an opening, that is, within the medium of art.s More than any other art, an art whose concept can no longer be derived from a priori definitions of genre and in which the society in which it is embedded has, as it were, irrupted into the level of content calls for a conceptualization that unites the self-transgression of art and its autonomy. Such a conceptualization, as I hope to demonstrate more conclusively in the next part, requires a post-metaphysical and anti-objectivist understanding of art and aesthetic experience.  

# Site Specificity  

![images/4c577836dea78960409b8c6e58268724ad84c128a13b66aec829930f608a6ad6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4ubGsUJ.jpeg)  

In art praxes of the last decade, the concept of aesthetic autonomy has played virtually no role. It has been relevant, if at all, only as the epitome of everything from which artists have sought to distance themselves. The autonomy, however, from which recent movementsdirect successors to the classical and neo-avant-gardes--have sought to distance themselves. is forever only the pseudo-autonomy of the Organic work of art of aestheticism, presumably independent of context, self-contained and self-sufficient. By contrast, if installation art has a common denominator, it is that these are, in the broadest terms, works that open themiselves quite literally toward their visible and invisible contexts or even render them explicitly thematic. Installations are context-sensitive with regard not only to the interior or exterior space in which they are exhibited but also to the social frameworks that influence the reception of art in general.2 Installation art thus engages society not from a sphere presumably untouched by it and in this sense autonomous: it also always addresses its own social dimension.  

Yet as the art historian Alex Potts correctly notes, the double sensitivity of installation art to context has led neither to an abolition of the traditional work of art nor to fundamentally new conditions of reception. Instead, installation art has quite fundamentally and polemically-that is, also with regard to traditional painting in a frame or sculpture on a pedestal-rejected the idea of context-independent art as ideological.3 For any experience of a work of art, as Adorno already saw, “depends on its ambience, its function, and, literally and figuratively, its locus." Today, art in general cannot avoid this insight. Not only have curatorial questions increasingly moved into the scope of artistic production, but the relatively new appearance of the figure of the curator and the establishment of curatorial studies programs are likewise effects of the growing awareness that the double contextualization of art touches upon the sphere of the artistic phenomenon itself. That is why advanced art today always has something of the installation to it; and a lack of contextual awareness is not infrequently a sign of provinciality. This nexus is quite evident in the field of painting. The most interesting contemporary German painters display a sensitivity to the rhetoric of hanging (as, for example, Michael Krebber and Albert Oehlen quite clearly do), if not moreover to the social site of their paintings (just as clearly visible in the work of Lukas Duwenhogger, Jutta Koether, and Andreas Siekmann).  

Under the title of "site specificity," installation art sharpens the reflection on the double localization of art by expressly mediating between its two poles: site-specific installation art aims to thematize the interwoven literal and social sites of art. It refects on the institutional, social, economic, political, and/or historical conditions that frame it $b y$ intervening formally in a given architecture or landscape. But it is in no way clear on which concept of site any particular consideration of site specificity in art is based. The same goes for the concept of space, which is always implicitly at stake when we speak of site-specific art, as the latter opens up to its concrete environmentthe space surrounding it. Taking up and critically engaging Martin Heidegger’s proposal for the manner of theorizing the interrelation between art and space, I will first argue that the phenomenological definition of the relationship between site and space constitutes a necessary if insufficient basis for an aesthetic conception of site-specific phenomena (3.1). This will once again also raise the question of the interventionist, critical, and political potential of site-specific installation art (3.2). For the reflection on the social site of art, if it occurs in the medium of art at all, is as irreducible to sociological definitions of its site or function as the refection on the literal site of art is to the phenomenological concept of situatedness. Particularly for art that thematizes its double context, the simple reference to the concrete and social context in which the work stands is insufficient to explain its specific context-reflectivity. Instead, we will have to criticize those critical endeavors that conclude that art is nothing but a  

Social fact from the insight that it is a social fact. Concerning site-specific installation practice, what is wrong --and I can in fact state this with Adorno-"'is not social reflection on artworks [...] but rather the subordination of artworks to abstract social correlations determined from above."s For such subordination means to pit ostensibly objective truths against subjective experience. I would argue that neither the critical point of early institution-critical site-specific works of the seventies nor that of installation art of the nineties, which positioned itself in larger social, cultural, economic, and political contexts, can be understood without recourse to said subjective experience. And understanding here means understanding such art as art. The critical momentum of site-specific works, as I will show, is not directed against. but on the contrary proceeds in, the mode of their aestheticity. The contextual reference of art exhibited by site-specific installations should thus be understood not as contrary to the autonomy of the aesthetic object but rather as one of the essential aspects defining this autonomy. To say so, however, means once again to detach the concept of aesthetic autonomy from its definitions of production or work aesthetics and to relate it instead to the specifically aesthetic structure of engagement with aesthetic objects, that is, to the specific qualities of aesthetic experience. To the extent that the concept of the work of art is thus internally tied to that of aesthetic experience, the social relation of art that is essential for its concept-and this is what I believe the best installation art makes manifest-—is not so much the "immanence of art in society” but rather "the immanence of society in the artwork'6 (even if this is also quite different from what Adorno means). We will return to this question.  

I will frst turn, with and against Heidegger, to a problem that at first glance might seem more concrete, that of the references installation art makes to its immediate spatial surroundings: the problem of the relationship of art and space.  

# 1 ArtandSpa MartHeer)  

The best-known example Heidegger discusses in \*The Origin of the Work of Art" is a painting by Vincent van Gogh showing a pair of shoes—-or "equipment" (Zeug).7 as Heidegger calls them. In them, Heidegger discovers not only the "world" and "earth" of a peasant woman, but at the same time that which essentially constitutes this "world and "earth": the "reliability” of the things that are part of them. "Van Gogh's painting,” writes Heidegger, "is the disclosure of what the equipment, the pair of peasant shoes, is in truth."8 This interpretation, whose reliability Heidegger does not seem to doubt? is surely also an example of what Karlheinz Stierle, referring to Heidegger's interpretation of Holderlin, called the “will to power of the allegorical reading."10 A similar critique could be offered in contrast to Heidegger's interpretation of his third example, one that is of greater interest regarding the problem of the relationship between art and space: a Greek temple. Like van Gogh's painting, if not even more explicitly, the temple represents to Heidegger the endowment of an original truth of the "Being of beings,"1l which can be not only "revealed" by the work but also apprehended in the work. But things are usually not so simple in Heidegger--which is why it is worth takingacloser look.  

What also emerges by virtue of the temple, according to Heidegger, is its natural environment, and more precisely, the materiality of this environment. Heidegger describes it--as always, rather pompouslyasfollows:  

Standing there, the building rests on the rocky ground. This resting of the work draws up out of the rock the mystery of that rock's clumsy yet spontaneous support. Standing there, the building holds its ground against the storm raging above it and so first makes the storm itself manifest in its violence. The luster and gleam of the stone, though itself apparently glowing only by the grace of the sun, yet first brings to light the light of the day, the breadth of the sky, the darkness of the night. The temple's firm towering makes visible the invisible space of air. (OWA, 42)  

And so forth. For our context, this passage is interesting in two respects, which Heidegger does not yet explicitly connect in “The Origin of the Work of Art"'. On the one hand, it is-—-with its emphasis on the temple's surroundings--part of Heidegger's phenomenology of places and spaces, elaborated in Being and Time and “Building Dwelling Thinking." On the other hand, however, it exhibits--with its emphasis on the materiality of such places and spaces——-those traits in Heidegger's philosophy of art that are irreducible to his theses (which are no doubt highly susceptible to ideological inflection) concerning the presentation of truth by art. I will begin with the first ofthese aspects.  

#  

The Greek temple is strikingly reminiscent of the example of the bridge that Heidegger offers in \*Building Dwelling Thinking, in that it, to begin with, makes its environment perceptible.1² The temple, like the profane bridge from \*Building Dwelling Thinking," is an example also of the fact that architecture opens up a way of viewing the natural environment. which is thus only constituted as such, as “native ground\* or "'region." But this is not yet, I think, a genuinely aesthetic quality of the temple. Rather, the claim that architecture fulfills such a disclosing function is part and parcel of Heidegger's general phenomenological argument in Being and Time against scientistic ontology, where he reclaims primacy for the life-world over the “objective reality' of the modern sciences, especially mathematical physics—-and therefore also primacy for the space disclosed by the life-world over mathematically abstract space.  

In Being and Time, Heidegger rejects the modern conception according to which the "objective presence” of things in space as measured by the natural sciences is thought to be ontologically prior to, as Heidegger puts it, their “subjective” use, their practical purpose, their "handiness." Things, Heidegger notes, do not exist "in themselves" at mutually indifferent places in a neutral space--they particularly do not exist as such in order then to be reshaped secondarily in and by the interaction with subjects with sensible qualities and practical meanings. Instead, according to Heidegger, the inverse is the case: the primary ontological disclosure of space proceeds via the "locations" or "places" established by a "relation of relevance,” a praxis of their use—which precedes the individual subject—that “makes room” for things. The “useful things"” we encounter daily, the "equipment." "do not simply have a place in space [...] but as useful things are essentially installed, put in their place, set up, and put in order."13 With useful objects, we might paraphrase, a social world is always already given: they each have their specific location in the praxis of a form of life. In this sense, too, that which is (reality) is always already spatially disclosed, but this spatiality is unlike the space measured by physics; it is instead a spatiality disclosed by a lifeworld that is constituted by the localities appertaining to the useful things in respective praxes. "The actual world," Heidegger writes in Being and Time, “discovers the spatiality of space belonging to it.'14  

Architecture plays a special role in the practical disclosure of space or spaces. Buildings constitute locations from which space, in the sense of a regional environment, is disclosed. For the (natural) environment is disclosed to us, according to Heidegger, only inasmuch as it has been embedded in the “relation of caretaking” of the human world and thus becomes a “region." Prior to their occupation by things, claims Heidegger, there are no locations and therefore also no spaces. In "Building Dwelling Thinking” on the example of the bridge,he writes:  

the location is not already here before the bridge is. Before the bridge stands, there are of course many spots along the stream that can be occupied by something. One of them turns out to be a location, and does so because of the bridge. Thus the bridge does not first come to a location to stand in it; rather, a location comes into existence only by virtue of the bridge. [...] By this site are determined the localities and the ways by which a space is provided for.  

[... J Accordingly, spaces receive their being from locations andnot from“space."15  

Here, “"space” denotes, of course, the space of mathematical physics. There may indeed be, writes Heidegger, “the possibility of measuring things and what they make room for, according to distances, spans, and directions, and of computing these magnitudes. But the fact that they are universally applicable to everything that has extension can in no case make numerical magnitudes the ground of the nature of spaces and locations that are measurable with the aid of mathematics."16  

The Dasein of human beings is essentially being-in-the-world; it is essentially, as Heidegger also says. grounded in "dwelling"” amongst things, that is. in a form of life with its historically changeable relations of meaning and practical relations to and among useful things. Hence. according to Heidegger, the spaces always already disclosed by a life-world along with these relations remain ontologically prior to the "space” of mathematical physics even when the latter may be recognized as "objective reality" with the aid of scientific method. Practically disclosed spatiality is ontologically prior to the methodical possibility of its transformation into measurable and neutral space.  

Now. this not yet genuinely aesthetic, larger argument on the disclosure of the environment through architecture seems to be helpful for understanding the definition of the relationship between “world"\* and "earth" that Heidegger offers in "The Origin of the Work of Art" -with regard to the example of the temple. “In setting up a world, the work sets forth the earth. This setting forth must be thought here in the strict sense of the word. The work moves the earth into the Open of a world and keeps it there. The work lets the earth be an earth" (OWA, 46). But the earth's “emerg[ence] as native ground" in this passage occurs more precisely because the temple “sets itself back' on it. In fact, this movement, which I will discuss in the next section, is, to Heidegger's mind, the decisive factor in the heightened perception of the temple's environment he describes. Moreover, this heightened perception seems to constitute a specifically aesthetic achievement of the temple that is not yet fully described by the phenomenological explication of the interrelation between location and space. On the contrary, the handiness of each "region," which is always already given with the handiness of useful things (be it a hammer or a bridge), is characterized \*in [an even] more primordial sense" than these things--at least once the respective praxis has been established, that is, phenomenologically first and foremost by "inconspicuous familiarity."17 A region thus often becomes accessible as such, according to Heidegger, when a thing can no longer be found in its place or when a house or a bridge is no longer there  

that is, when a previously established practice of usage is interrupted, revealing the region opened up along with and by this practice.18 The particular and particularly aesthetic achievement of the temple, by contrast, seems to consist in the fact that it reveals its environment by being there. As a work of art, the temple structurally transports us back to the point at which its location is constituted, to the point, that is, at which its region, too, is not yet familiar. We might say that the earth can only “emerge” as “native ground” when, in the context of the experience of the temple, it becomes essentially un-homely, un-native, or unfamiliar, moving out of the dimension of its handiness and thus simultaneously out of the relationship of meaning of a "world"or inevitably withdrawing from it time and again. "The earth,” Heidegger writes accordingly, "is essentially self-secluding. To set forth the earth means to bring it into the Open as the selfsecluding" (OWA, 47). The temple structurally transports us back to the point of the constitution of a “world" because the latter enters into a “striving” (Streit) with the “earth." In fact, claims Heidegger, the “work-being of the work" exists in this “striving" between "world” and “earth" (OWA, 49-50). And precisely this “striving between world and earth" can further be read--with, but, in an important sense, also, against, Heidegger——as a logic of the aesthetic that fundamentally resists any ideology of a presence of truth.  

#  

The term “earth" in Heidegger should be understood as referring not only to a work's environment-although this, as we will see, is noteworthy enough in our context-but also more generally to the materiality of the work of art. The self-seclusion of “earth,” according to Heidegger, can be understood generally as the material aspect of the work of art that eludes its function as matter (for the manufacture of useful things) or as bearer (of meaning).19 The material of the  

work of art does not, like the material of a useful thing, become invisible in its practical handiness or serviceability, but on the contrary only emerges as such in the work (see OWA, 45 46). Accordingly, it is not absorbed in the world potentially opened up by the workthat is, in the horizon of meaning potentially opened up by the work. Instead, time and again the work sets itself back “into the earth" (OWA, 46)that is, it withdraws from "every disclosure” into its materiality. which thus emerges in the first place (OWA, 47). Yet we should not imagine this in a positivist sense as an emergence of the materiality of the work of art as such. Rather, for Heidegger, the material exists as aesthetic only in its striving but irresolvable relation to the "world': that is to say, it exists only in and by virtue of its tense relation to meaning. The attempt to define the material as such in positivistic terms misses the aesthetic point. If, for instance, we analyze the color of a work of art "in rational terms by measuring its wavelengths.," Heidegger writes, "it is gone" (OWA, 47). “Earth" is only in its relation to \*"world." According to what I have argued thus far concerning the logic of the aesthetic, we could also put it in this way: the materiality of the work of art is aesthetic only in its relation to the formations of interrelation and meaning performed on it. Yet because the material of the work of art can never authenticate these formations of interrelation and meaning, any possible formation of meaning is referred back to the facticity of the material, which, for its part, always already suggests latent meaningfulness and invites new formations of meaning. A similar structure underlies Heidegger's talk of "world” and “earth." He explains it as such:  

World and earth are essentially different from one another and yet are never separated. The world grounds itself on the earth, and earth juts through world. But the relation between world and earth does not wither away into the empty unity of opposites unconcerned with one another. The world, in resting upon the earth, strives to surmount it. As self-opening it cannot endure anything closed. The earth, however, as sheltering and concealing, tends always to draw the world into itself and keep it there. The opposition of world and earth is a striving. [...]  

[...] In setting up a world and setting forth the earth, the work is an instigating of this striving. This does not happen so that the work should at the same time settle and put an end to the conflict in an insipid agreement, but so that the strife may remain a strife.(OWA,48-49)

What appears at the center of Heidegger's processual definition of the work2 as an inconclusive striving is the interesting term Ge-stell ("enframing").21 This is interesting not only because Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe's French translation of Heidegger translates the term as “installation,"22 or because the etymology of the term “installation" leads back to the Old Germanic noun stall ("position"), whose collective noun Gestell, in turn points back, on the one hand, to the Middle High German gestelle ("mill support” or “frame") and, on the other hand, to the Old High German gistelli ("position,” “place," "compilation"). We will come back to this in the next section. For the time being, I would like to focus on the fact that the term Ge-stell in Heidegger is moreover defined by a two-fold horizon of meaning that equally characterizes the term installation: that of technology and art. On the one hand, Heidegger's term designates the specifically aesthetic mode of being of a work as the opposition of setting up a "world" and setting forth an “earth." Ge-stell is thus the name of the process that constitutes the aesthetic form or shape as aesthetic. "The strife that is brought into the rift and thus set back into the earth and thus fixed in a place," Heidegger writes in "The Origin of the Work of Art,” “is figure, shape, Gestalt. Createdness of the work means: truth being fixed in place in the figure. Figure is the structure in whose shape the rift composes and submits itself. [...] What is here called figure, Gestalt, is always to be thought in terms of the particular placing (Stellen) and framing or framework (Ge-stell) as which the work occurs when it sets itself up and sets itself forth" (OWA, 64). On the other hand, however, the term Ge-stell is also Heidegger's \*key expression for the nature of modern technology" (OWA, 84). In the context of his philosophy of technology, the term designates an understanding of Being marked by the modern metaphysics of the subject, which provokes the self-empowerment of instrumental reason in all areas of life in the first place.23 Reality, according to Heidegger, presents and produces itself under the dominion of Ge-stell as a calculable relation of powers, as a "supply" to be exploited. At first glance, this definition of Ge-stell, as the epitome of a radicalized Cartesianism, seems to have nothing at all to do with that of "The Origin of the Work of Art."  

The problem of the modern subject-object ontology, however, not only stands at the center of Heidegger’s philosophy of technology, it also-—-as in the other protagonists of the aesthetic discourse of modernity we have discussed—forms the background for his reflections on art. Despite political differences, Heidegger likewise declares art to be the privileged site where this ontology may be overcome. Yet he too does not imagine such overcoming in terms of an opening of asymmetrical subject-object relations brought about by the structure of aesthetic experience (as I have implied in my reading of some of his rather deconstructive-sounding formulations). Especially in the context of this argument, art, for Heidegger, is instead the potential site of an event of truth of proportions commensurate to \*"the history ofBeing.""  

In this context, Heidegger considers the fact that art and technology-as different modes of bringing forth—can be traced back to a common origin, to the techne of antiquity, as decisive. This connection should not be misunderstood as being “practical" or "technical" in a superficial sense. In classical thought, bringing-forth or techne is tied to a form of knowledge or episteme. In this sense, the poietic, bringing-forth achievement of techne does not originally designate simply some kind of practical activity. Rather, the word techne denotes, as Heidegger says in the essay on the work of art, “a mode of knowing. [...] For Greek thought the nature of knowing consists in aletheia, that is, in the uncovering of beings. It supports and guides all comportment toward beings. Techne, as knowledge experienced in the Greek manner, is a bringing forth of beings in that it brings forth present beings as such beings out of concealedness and specifically into the unconcealedness of their appearance; techne never signifies the action of making” (OWA, 59). In view of the common origin of technology and art in Greek techne, we can now understand Heidegger's double use of the term Ge-stell, which initially seemed confusing: "The word stellen [to set upon],” Heidegger writes in "The Question Concerning Technology,"in the name Ge-stell [Enframing] not only means challenging. At the same time it should preserve the suggestion of another Stellen from which it stems, namely, that producing and presenting [Her- und Dar-stellen] which, in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forth into unconcealment. This producing that brings forth--e.g., the erecting of a statue in the temple precinctand the challenging ordering now under consideration are indeed fundamentally different, and yet they remain related in their essence. Both are ways of revealing, of aletheia."24  

On the basis of this conception of the essential relatedness of art and technology, Heidegger--at the end of a 1953 lecture held, it should be noted, in a series on \*"The Arts in the Age of Technology" expressed the hope that awareness of the essence of technology as a mode of “revealing” would also open up the perspective of a “saving power."25 And Heidegger does not imagine such salvation in the form of a return to a noninstrumental relation to the self and to the world-he means something much more and quite different: since man has a constitutive share in this "revealing,” he can in principle also open up to what "grants" him to \*endure” as “revealer” or what even "needs" him in order to become disclosed or "revealed" as beings:26 to the \*"address" that comes from Being itself. For Heidegger, the fundamental possibility of such a receptive opening-up also contains the hope for a more essential historicality of mankind keeping in mind that history (Geschichte) in Heidegger should not be confused with merely the historical, rather it should be seen in the series it forms with the terms "fate” (Geschick) and "destiny' (Schicksal).27  

Now. it is well known that Heidegger considers language the proper site of the sending of history---understood as “the dispensation of Being itself\*28—-and the poet (specifically, Holderlin) its privileged medium.29 In "The Question Concerning Technology,” poetry, “in the midst of the extreme danger,\*30 is likewise characterized as a particularly privileged site of "more primally granted,” that is, poietic revealing.31 Against the dominance of the Ge-stell that presumably penetrates all areas of modern life and thought--that is, the ostensibly total dominance of the modern metaphysics of the subject-—Heidegger conceptualizes art as a site where, at least potentially, a truer truth than anything so far held to be true might reveal itself. Once conceived as total, the dominance of Ge-stell can be broken only by a radically new beginning. And this new beginning must consist in the return to a presumably original, primal truth of Being (Sein)-- in this context, Heidegger occasionally writes this as Seyn—-which, as it were, murmurs itself out of the concealed and into the veritably "poetic mind,” in order to become “said” and to thereby become a historically endowed being.  

Here, at the latest, the elements of Heidegger's discourse convene in the "jargon of authenticity"32 in such a way that, even in 1953, Nazism latently “comes to presence,” as Heidegger might have put it, in the ideological echo chamber of their constellation. At this time he certainly interprets National Socialism itself as a symptom of the dominance of Ge-stell, based on the late insight that the "truth of the Being of beings"” obviously did not in the end arrive in 1933. Nonetheless, the projection, which Heidegger retains even in this critique of Nazism, of a reversal in the history of Being called for by the presumable total dominance of Ge-stell, and which is to be brought about “poetically,” leads directly back to the particularly ideologically susceptible concluding paragraphs of "The Origin of the Work of Art" (1935-36), where we read: $^{\circ\circ}\mathrm{Art}\left[\ldots\right]$ is historical. This means not only that art has a history in the external sense that in the course of time it, too, appears along with many other things, and in the process changes and passes away and offers changing aspects for historiology. Art is history in the essential sense that it grounds history” (OWA, 7'7). And Heidegger conceives history—- and this is of course significant for the potential ideological charge of these sentences—in the figure of the new beginning that returns to the primal, as the “transporting of a people into its appointed task as entrance into that people's endowment" (OWA, 77; see also OWA,74-76). It is no wonder that Heidegger draws parallels between an art thus reduced to the function of presenting the basic traits of a new historical existence-such that a people can recognize itself in them”3 the \*act that founds a political state"-and a certain form of \*questioning thinking" that he attributes to himself (OWA, 62).  

In view of this argumentative constellation, we must firmly disassociate Heidegger's notion of the \*setting-into-work of truth” from the history of Being-—-that is. if we wish to make his ideas fruitful for the philosophical discipline of which he thought merely executed the modern subject-object relationship in its own domain that his thinking. surpassing and undercutting the differentiation of philosophy into disciplines, had set out to defeat: aesthetics.34 To do so, we have to annul the aspect of the meaning of Ge-stell that connects Heidegger's essay on the work of art with the one on technology. For in order to connect Ge-stell of "The Origin of the Work of Art” and that of ""The Question Concerning Technology" in a way that places it in a fateful "history of Being,” Heidegger must reduce the aesthetic meaning of Ge-stell to "poietic revealing” (OWA, 84). What is lost in doing so, however, is the internally antagonistic structure of Ge-stell: and only this internal antagonism, I think, makes this concept an aesthetic one.  

Even more: in a way that is probably entirely different from what Heidegger intended. the internally antagonistic structure of Ge-stell by itself also represents a specifically aesthetic opening of asymmetrical subject-object relationships. This opening, however, is intelligible only once art is no longer overburdened with the \*history of Being,” that is, once it is no longer reduced to the function of founding the basic traits of the historical existence of a people, an existence whose “essential measure" is supposedly transmitted by a Being that eludes tne veings Accorumgiy, tue amuiguity, stesstu vy lciuegget, inherent in the definition of art as the “setting-into-work of truth" with regard to the question of whether it imagines the truth as subject or as object, should not be taken to relate to the “belonging-together of Being and Saying,”" that is, to the notion that the mysterious truth of the Being of beings must, as subject, communicate itself to man so that the latter can ultimately determine it as object (see OWA, 87) Rather, the ambiguity of the definition of art as “setting-into-work of truth" must then be related to the structure of the “"truth event" itself, the latter conceived as an indefinite event that essentially plays out between receiving subject and aesthetic object. Only by reference to the structure of aesthetic experience, I think, can this event be given a genuinely aesthetic meaning. It is significant in this context that an aesthetic experience cannot simply be voluntaristically induced on any arbitrary object by virtue of an “attitude shift." Instead, it is always dependent on the aesthetic object that must sustainably provoke such an experience. The event that renders the work a work of art is an event that takes place between the aesthetic object and the receiving subject, and in a fashion that is, from the outset, not entirely subject to the latter's control. For the aesthetic experience begins, as we read in Heidegger, with a "displacement? (OWA, 66). Yet again, we must interpret Heidegger from a critical standpoint: this displacement must be understood not as one into a domain of original truth, but as an alienation of the aesthetic object from our ordinary understanding, as a fundamental unsettling of our access to the aesthetic object, as a peculiar distance of the aesthetic object that provokes aesthetic refection and thus sets the work in motion. Only in the reflective confrontation of the receiving subject with powers that it develops (in a way that it cannot entirely control) in relation to the aesthetic object can the object's representational potential be set free such that its material can time and again, and unexpectedly, show itself to be what is for structural reasons irreducible to the interpretive processes enacted on it. The aesthetic blocking of the subject's instrumental command over the concrete aesthetic object is, I think, intelligible only if we understand it according to the internally antagonistic structure of the specifically aesthetic object relation, in which the object is in principle irreducible to the opening of a world or a horizon of meaning, irrespective of whether the latter is conceived --as in Heidegger--as something irreducibly new in relation to our world, or simply as an accentuation of already existing relations of meaning.  

But what does one gain from such a reformulation of Heidegger with respect to the concept of site-specific installation? Initially, that the aesthetic concept of installation has nothing to do with its technological meaning-—-in either the ancient or the modern sense of technology. It may seem obvious that installation art should not be conceived on the basis of plumbing. Still, the fact that the concept of installation designates not only an art form but simultaneously also the mode of its production has led many to lend it a technologicalinstrumental meaning that ties it to the technical act of production performed by an artist/creator (who, by the way, is in this discursive context still usually male). In contrast, the aesthetic concept of installation must be thought of--in its ambiguity--as based on the Ge-stell of the processes of aesthetic experience that “set up and set forth. This means. primarily, nothing other than what I have been saying all along: that the autonomous logic of the aesthetic can be understood only with reference to the structure of aesthetic experience. That the critical effort necessary to make none other than Heidegger's ideas productive for this hypothesis is worthwhile will become entirely clear only once we can connect these ideas to his phenomenological reflections on the relation between site and space. To this end, I will now turn to a text on sculpture in which Heidegger himself examines the relationship between his reflections on art and those on space (which we have so far discussed separately). By reading Heidegger's philosophy of art in the way I propose (i.e., against his intentions), we can learn a great deal about the central role of the phenomenological concept of site and space for an aesthetic understanding of the site-specific installation. What is interesting in this text about the relationship between art and space is not, once again, the basic structure of the aesthetic, which I have already explained at length, but the way in which it can be explicated with and against Heidegger via the example of sculpture. Regarding his ability to find separate terms for different cases contained within a more general logic (but regarding only this ability), we can in a certain sense read even Heidegger himself as a "deconstructive” author.  

#  

In his lecture dedicated to the sculptor Eduardo Chillida, Heidegger begins with the problem of the relationship between art and space by enumerating seemingly obvious points: “Sculptured structures are bodies. Their matter, consisting of different materials, is variously formed. The forming of it happens by demarcation as setting up an enclosing and excluding border. Herewith, space comes into play. Becoming occupied by the sculptured structure, space receives its special character as closed, breached and empty volume. A familiar state of affairs, yet puzzling."36 For, despite the familiarity of such description, it is not at all clear what notion of space we presuppose when we speak of art's “engagement” with space. Heidegger distances himself sharply from the respective art-critical jargon in order to ask the fundamental question of what notion of space we should have in mind when talking about the relationship of art and space. Must we think of the space in which we may come across a sculpture (a park, a gallery), or the space that becomes visible amid the volumes of a sculpture--must we think of all this on the basis of the dominant mathematical-physical notion of space as defined by Galileo and Newton? After what I have said in the first section of this chapter, it will hardly be surprising that Heidegger definitively answers this question in the negative. Indeed, we may calculate the volume of a sculpture in relation to, for example, the white cube of the gallery, to determine whether it is technically possible to install it there. And from the perspective of artistic production, too, this aspect of the work is surely important, even unavoidable. But these calculations, according to Heidegger, actually have nothing ontologically illuminating to say about the relationship between art and space. On the contrary, speaking of measurable distances and volumes in this respect is systematically misleading. For the relationship of a sculpture to the space around it, claims Heidegger, should not at all be conceived as one between a self-contained volume and an outside that is neutral toward it. In Heidegger's radical recommendation to art theory, "What is named by the world \*volume, the meaning of which is only as old as modern technological natural science, would have to lose its name"(AS, 123).  

Like architecture, sculpture, for Heidegger, is initially an “embodiment of places" (AS, 123), which in turn disclose, or rather, “make room for," the spaces-as-regions. Sculpture should thus be conceived neither as \*occupying” nor as "dealing with” or engaging a preexistent space (AS, 123). "We would have to learn to recognize,” Heidegger Writes,  

that things themselves are places and do not merely belong to a place.  

[ ... J Place is not located in a pre-given space, after the manner of physical-technological space. The latter unfolds itself only through the reigning of places of a region. (AS, 123)   
"The interplay of art and space,” he continues, "'would have to be   
thought from out of the experience of place and region” (AS, 123). Now,   
in our context, it is of course quite remarkable that Heidegger   
speaks of an interplay of art and space. For such interplay already   
became apparent in the pre-installational and, we should note, decidedly   
'geometrical' objects of Minimal art: its cubes (Smith, Judd) and   
modular structures (Sol LeWitt).37 It is indeed obvious that in order  

to reach a better understanding of this interplay of art and space in aesthetic experience we should draw not on the mathematical-physical but on the phenomenological concept of space. But the phenomenological elucidation of the “experience of location and region,”" I maintain, does not yet amount to a satisfactory explication of the specifically aesthetic interplay of art and space.38  

In examining the example of the temple in \*The Origin of the Work of Art," we had already established that its aesthetic potential does not consist in its mere embodiment of a location and the disclosure of a region this entails. Rather, the temple, as an aesthetic object, structurally transports us back, time and again, to the point of origin where its "location" is constituted and where this "location" siimultaneously "makes room' for a region; that is to say, to the point where the temple enters into a significant relation with its environment. Heidegger's remarks on sculpture become relevant for us primarily where the terms he offers to explicate the interplay of art and space can be made to match this logic.  

Interestingly, the site or sculpture's “making room" for the region must be understood, for Heidegger, in a “twofold manner[,] as granting and arranging": "First, making-room admits something. It lets openness hold sway which, among other things, grants the appearance of things present to which human dwelling sees itself consigned. On the other hand, making-room prepares for things the possibility to belong to their relevant whither and, out of this, to each other" (AS, 123). Once again, we cannot fail to overhear the side of Heidegger promoting the “history of Being” in this double meaning of making-room as both “granting” and “arranging": the double trait of granting and arranging should accordingly be understood in the figure of an arrangement or founding of being that is receptively granting towards the address of Being.39 Still, the double trait of making-room as granting (of the open) and as arranging (of relations of reference) can also be read, with and against Heidegger, as aesthetic antagonism. We can then relate the double trait of granting and arranging. which, according tc Heidegger, is the distinctive accomplishment of sculpture, to the internal antagonism of the--- aesthetically conceived--Ge-stell on the basis of which, we recall, Heidegger believed the concept of form/shape/figure (Gestalt) would need to be rethought as well (see OWA, 63). What does this mean for the relationship between art and space?  

To Heidegger's mind. there is no fixed form (Gestalt)--the sculpture—that we may subsequently, secondarily, relate to \*the”’ space. Rather. the sculptural form is constituted in part in its correspondence with what. by virtue of this correspondence, it "makes room” for as a region. This means, however, that not only does the sculpture \*"make room' for the region. the latter also conversely becomes aesthetically significant for the sculpture—-it becomes part of the work, becomes aesthetic material itself. Yet, this making-room should not simply be understood as the "arrangement of significant relations of reference but should at the same time--and, I would like to add, as a countertrait-be related to "granting” the “open." A “granting," I would like to conceive, once again, with a certain violence toward Heidegger, as the emancipation of the things of a region from their significant "belonging together" (AS, 123). Because the correspondences that a sculpture "makes room" for--correspondences with an environment that these very correspondences disclose in the first place—cannot be an objective part of the work, while the work, on the other hand, cannot be seen as simply and objectively separated from its environment, the arrangement of ("world"-ly) relations of reference remains constitutively interrelated to that other process, which time and again dissolves such relations, thereby admitting the open. In \*The Origin of the Work of Art," this process bears the name “earth." The logic according to which insignificant matter, the outer frame, the spatial exterior, is capable of folding itself into the center of aesthetic significance, only to be, at the very next moment, nothing more than a minor matter, a window in a gallery, an uneven spot on the floor, a tree, air ... -this logic could also be called "parergonal, to use Derrida's word.40  

Is it mere coincidence that the Middle High German version of Gestell means"framework"?  

As Derrida has shown in his examination of Kant's Critique of Judgment, the problem of the frame can be considered one of the most important problems of traditional aesthetics insofar as the latter engaged the question of what constitutes the aesthetic object, the work of art, and what remains a mere externality to it. According to Derrida, and I would like to follow his lead here, it is precisely the unanswerability of this question that must be recognized as an essential structural feature of the aesthetic. It is a characteristic mark of all aesthetic experience that the question of what constitutes the work of art and what is ascribed to it as merely external must remain open. The logic of the parergon, of the frame, of the border, pervades all art. And this is literally true, in almost palpable fashion, in the case of sculpture. Accordingly, its relation to space should not be misconceived as that of a self-enclosed body to its outside. Instead we should consider the sculptural form (with and against Heidegger) from the perspective of Ge-stell--that is, as dynamic. In fact, Heidegger conceives the reinforcing boundary, the framing outline of the form, as anything but static. The boundary is "the repose," writes Heidegger, only “"in the fullness of motion” (OWA, 83). The boundary is the form's outline or design [Umriss] only insofar as it is also understood to be its breach or rift [Durchriss] (see OWA, 63). The boundary, for Heidegger, is “"brought into the rift-design [Riss] (OWA, 63); it is, as it were, the site of the striving that constitutes the sculptural work as a work of art.  

Now, this striving, as I have said above, attains its specifically aesthetic meaning only in relation to processes of aesthetic experience. The artist may, of course, compute or calculate the relation between art and space during production, and the work may be accordingly installed in the space of the gallery or a public space; but these calculations, as necessary as they may be for the production of a work, cannot anticipate or guarantee the internal aesthetic logic that the interplay between the work of art and the space may unfold in each concrete case where an individual subject of aesthetic experience is confronted with the work. Only in such confrontation does the  

sculpture disclose a space-as-region, and it does so in the representational potential of the latter. For the "made room [for] space has nothing to do with the neutral space of geometry or mathematics, nor, however, does it disappear into the “inconspicuous familiarity41 of the space disclosed by the life-world. Instead, the space opens up aesthetically only by \*shrink[ing] from every disclosure” (OWA, 47); that is, by remaining constitutively distanced vis-a-vis the “tendency toward nearness"42 which is inherent to all disclosure in the life-world.  

Just as describing the volume of sculpture in merely technical terms   
will fail to grasp the parergonal interplay of art and space, a discourse   
on the emptiness of space that conceives it as mere in-between space   
will remain inadequate.3 "Often enough, Heidegger writes, [emptiness] appears to be a deficiency. Emptiness is held then to be a failure to fill up a cavity or gap.  

Yet presumably the emptiness is closely allied to the special character of place, and therefore no failure, but a bringing-forth. [... ] In the verb "to empty" (leeren) the word "collecting" (Lesen), taken in the original sense of the gathering which reigns in place. is spoken. [...]  

Emptiness is not nothing. It is also no deficiency. In sculptural embodiment, emptiness plays in the manner of a seeking-projecting instituting of places. (As, 123-4)  

The emptiness of space can become significant in relation to sculpture when it is read or gathered; it is not so in and of itself. Rather, it "plays,” as Heidegger puts it, in the “place forming characteristics of sculptured embodiment,” or more precisely, in its tendency "to seek places"—that is, to form, in the interpretive processes undertaken by the subject of aesthetic experience, a “situation" (see 1.2) or a "scene” (see 2.3.2) with the space surrounding it. But the emptiness plays, as we should now add, also in the tendency toward the “open"—that is to say, in the antagonistic tendency of the scenes or situations thus outlined to fall apart again and again in these very processes, only to be collected and arranged in potentially new and different ways by a renewed reading. Because the “rift" can never be closed once and for all, space is not disclosed by sculpture but emerges in its representational potential. This is the sense in which I would read Heidegger's remark that the sculpture must be conceived as an "embodiment of places” that "in preserving and opening a region, hold something free gathered around them"(AS, 11).  

Heidegger's philosophy of art is always, to a greater or lesser degree, unintentionally comical because it is so absolutely humorless in its rhetoric of authenticity. And so it may have seemed like an unlikely place to look for a definition of the relation between art and space, but Heidegger offers one that can be surprisingly productive—in opposition to his resentment of philosophical aesthetics and certainly also to his own taste in art--for an aesthetic understanding of sitespecific installations. This definition has been developed on the example of sculpture, but we might speculate whether-—-Heidegger's programmatic ostentation of provinciality notwithstanding—it is pure coincidence that “Art and Space” was originally published in 1969, at a time, that is, when visual artists had already begun to make the various spaces of presentation the subject of artistic work. In fact, sensitivity to the interplay of art and space has been rising since the sixties (since Minimal art) to such a degree that today's sculptors, if they have not become outright installation artists, understand sculpture in an installational sense, that is, in its constellation with the space surrounding it. In this sense, the concept of installation art designates a sculptural praxis that has become self-reflective. The difference between a pre-critical understanding of the relation between art and space in the fifties and what came afterward can be illustrated by many examples, such as the difference between the neat Henry Moore sculpture in front of the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin and the long narrow LED displays Jenny Holzer installed on the ceiling of the same Mies van der Rohe building. In comparison to Holzer's installation, Moore’s sculpture looks so incredibly dated, almost like a caricature of modern art, not least because of the emphasis on volume, on the sculptural body, it embodies. As Moore's sculpture seems to claim independence from the architecture, it shrinks into being its decoration: a tchotchke, a knickknack, somewhat moving because it is so out of place. Holzer's installation, by contrast, marks the Mies van der Rohe building in such a way that this building itself becomes legible as a steel-and-glass sculpture, one in whose form the space of the city plays. It would certainly be excessive——as well as unfair, in view of Moore's or Eduardo Chillida's work--to claim that the theorization of sculpture in the sense of an interplay of art and space only became possible with the arrival of installation forms in art since the late sixties. Yet we can say that the practices Rosalind E. Krauss charted in her 1979 essay under the telling title "Sculpture in the Expanded Field"\*+practices I would call installational in the widest sense—-have explicitly thematized something fundamental not only for sculpture but, more or less manifestly, for all spatial art: the tendency of such work to transgress the boundaries separating it from its environment. I use the term spatial art here intentionally, for this is just as true of painting. We need only think of its relation to the picture frame, or of the almost syntactic arrangements created by the hanging of an exhibition, which greatly influence the potential meaning of individual paintings.\*s It is not by accident that the term "installation,” when used in museum practice, initially designated, and continues to designate, the physical arrangement of an exhibition.  

Yet such a tendency toward boundary-breaking is obviously not an objective quality of individual works or their arrangement. Rather, it must be understood with reference to the processuality of aesthetic experience, which sets works to their boundary-breaking work. Conversely, the movement toward boundary-breaking is a constitutive element of aesthetic experience. Context-reflectivity, conceived on the basis of a theory of experience, is then not counter to aesthetic autonomy, but rather an essential aspect of its definition:  

it is part of a specifically aesthetic operation of reflection by virtue of which the works are constituted as aesthetic, processually emancipated, and only thus unleashed as art. As we have seen, the fact that this is the case has in turn already become a subject in art. The dependence of the work of art on the performative perspective of the subjects of aesthetic experience has been reflected in art since the sixties under the title of "inclusion of the viewer." It is no surprise, then, that, from the beginning, phenomenology played a significant role for artists and critics in reference to this dependence. What they read, however, was not the German but the French variety of phenomenology: Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception.\*6 And they read it primarily with reference to a dimension of aesthetic experience that plays virtually no role in the German version: namely, the physical.  

Now, this dimension is one we should not lose sight of, particularly with regard to the experience of installation art. For the latter indeed almost always entails a heightened awareness of the movement of our own bodies in space. And according to Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological argument, we generally ought not to misconceive the consciousness of the spatiality of our own bodies as a kind of total consciousness of the presence of body parts in objective space, but imagine instead a dynamic spatial body-consciousness that is always already oriented toward the tasks and situations at hand-that is, toward a praxis. "My body," says Merleau-Ponty, "is wherever there is something to be done."47 \*If I stand in front of my desk and lean on it with both hands, only my hands are stressed and the whole of my body trails behind them like the tail of a comet.\*48 Yet the aesthetic situation, complimentary to and by extension of my previous remarks, necessarily interrupts the pragmatic belonging-to-the-world of the body because its meaning is constitutively open. That is why the aesthetic situation digs. as it were. a zone of reflection into the full world disclosed by our praxis, a zone in which the \*"body” of the viewer may then also enter into consciousness as a \*system of possible actions."4 This, we might say, once again using Fried's words, is what makes the body in the aesthetic situation "vaguely monstrous."50) For as long as the viewer perceives himself in a pragmatically undefined relation to the aesthetic object, he will reflect on his role in this relation, and on what he is doing in this situation. And in the case of installation or sculpture-—-that is to say, of those arts for which the viewer's movements. positions, and perspectives become potentially significant--this reflection concerns not only the general activity of "continual reading" (Fried), but also (and the two are intertwined) this movement as a way of accessing the world and things that is equiprimordial with perception (Merleau-Ponty).51 Meaning on/in the work of spatial art is always constituted, as Krauss has pointed out, drawing on Merleau-Ponty, quite literally from “this position and this perspective."52  

As for the reception of phenomenology in the sixties, however, it has indeed often been objected that it can only do justice to the phenomenon of site-specific art to a limited extent.53 For the term "site specificity" has been used in art-theoretical and critical discourse since the seventies to designate not so much the correlate of a subjective-physical experience of space but rather a critical or even political quality of installations. “Site specificity” has been a rubric subsuming dramatically aggressive (in contrast with the implicit intertextuality of all art) mise-en-scenes of various but always concrete institutional, political, economic, and cultural contexts in  

the “text" of the installation——which, for this reason among others, was site-specific and often also limited in time. As site-specific art, the art of installation reflects on the conditions that frame it. And with this new sensitivity to context, no space will ever appear as simply neutral again, least of all the white cube: “the viewer,” of whom I have thus far referred to unproblematically in the male form, using the term as synonymous with "receiving subject," likewise loses his neutrality. More interesting installations in particular seem to address "the viewer” (and “his” body) in “his” social, cultural, and gendered Specificity.  

But there is no contradiction between the fact that aesthetically experienced space is by no means neutral and the phenomenological grounding of space. On the contrary, the space disclosed by the lifeworld as described by phenomenology is a space constitutively pervaded by meaning: "It is of the essence of space," Merleau-Ponty writes, "to be ‘always already constituted,' and we shall never come to understand it by withdrawing into a worldless perception."54 And it is this space, pervaded by meaning, that is the precondition of the possibility of its aesthetic experience. For no aesthetic experience is conceivable outside its relation to meaning--even and precisely if in the process of this experience the recognition of relations of meaning from the life-world that usually pervade the space or are semantically \*“arranged" in it by an artistic work becomes problematic. Because it is always already permeated by meaning, aesthetic reflection cannot be constrained either to the space of art in the literal sense nor to the basic physicality of the act of our aesthetic viewing; rather, it tends to extend outward to everything-—-including the institutional or cultural silent assumptions that shape our perceptions, sometimes entering even into its physical dimension. But what does all this mean for the critical ambitions of site-specific art?  

# 3.2. Installation and Intervention  

In 1984. Richard Serra wrote: \*Sculpture, if it has any potential at all, has the potential to create its own place and space, and to work in contradiction to the places and spaces where it is created. I am interested in work where the artist is a maker of an 'anti-environment' which takes its own place or makes its own situation, or divides or declares its own area."ss In a certain sense, every sculpture, but also every installational intervention in a public or institutional space, in fact constitutes "its own" space in the sense explained above: by aesthetically "'making room" for this space, making it legible through itself. But this also means that it puts space at a distance. That is why I think that Serra's term \*anti-environment? is an apt description for the space aesthetically made room for by its correspondence with sculpture or installation. For this aesthetically made-room-for space always also works against the significant relations that are set up by any given artistic intervention. Although the aesthetic experience always also consists in a recognition of relations of meaning, space, insofar as it is experienced in relation to the artistic work, constitutively eludes such disclosures time and again. The aesthetically made-room-for situation superimposes, as it were, a virtual space—-a second-order space defined by the play of meaning set in motion by the work's relation to its visible as well as its invisible contexts—-upon the space defined by the life-world. This play cannot be brought to an end because the “world" of the work of art, for structural reasons, exists only in fractured form (in striving with the "earth"); because the visible and invisible contexts that enrich the work of art with meaning can always only be established experimentally by the viewer, but never objectively guaranteed by the work of art itself. Art therefore sets up relations of meaning only insofar as they are also repeatedly emancipated from their significant coherent interrelations: that is, insofar as openness is admitted. In this sense, we could say that the work of art is constitutively siteless. Site-specific art, if it merits this title (that of art), must be thought in conjunction with this structural sitelessness of art. This is the case, as I would like to show in the next section, also and in particular in installations that not only reflect on the space in which they are installed as one pervaded by specific meanings, but in so doing simultaneously open up within themselves an external, sociological perspective on the locus of art.  

# 3.2. 1. Institutional Critique  

In the medium of art, the space surrounding works of art became explicitly thematic as a space pervaded by meaning with the so-called institution-critical art of the early seventies. In the seventies, the critique of the “institution of art," that is, the critique of what qualifies as art at any time, which avant-gardes have continually engaged in since the beginning of modernism, grew into, among other things, a critique of the institutions of art, of the “art business." After art broke free even of its conventional subdivision into genres——that is, in what we might call the fully developed nominalist situation—-it might have seemed as though it was now the institutional context that determined what was or was not art. \*"For better or worse [the white cube] is the single major convention through which art is passed," observed Brian O'Doherty in his now legendary essay "Inside the White Cube."56 And in fact, at the beginning of the seventies, the white cube (of the gallery or museum space) became the focus of artistic attention in two interrelated respects: with regard to the exhibition conventions associated with it and to its social function. This two-fold reflection on institutional spaces is simultaneously a refection on the double locus of art. Site-specific art is born with institution-critical art. It reflects on the concrete spatial conditions of its presentation, with a view to its social locus.  

As is well known, the gallery is a site where art is not only exhibited but also traded, where it is sold as a luxury article. In light of this function, then, site-specific procedures have served since their beginnings, as James Meyer summarizes, "as a mode of refusal of the system of art's commodification."57 Site-specific work, according to the intention of its producer, defies circulation as a commodity in a very literal fashion. Whereas the traditional, organic work of art is independent of its context in the sense that it can change locationsmoving from exhibition space to bourgeois domestic space-- -sitespecific works are tied to the concrete space where they are exhibited.s8 In 1968, for example, Richard Serra poured molten lead into the corner where the wall meets the foor in a warehouse owned by Leo Castelli in New York. Removing Splashing, as he entitled this sitespecific installation, would amount to destroying it.  

In contrast to Walter Benjamin, who saw the increasing independence of the exhibition value from the cultic value as a tendency toward the democratization of art and culture (aithough, of course, he wrote about film, where the situation is somewhat different),9 the most advanced visual artists of the late sixties and early seventies considered the ability of the work of art to be exhibited anywhere to precisely be the problem since this ability ultimately served the interests of the ruling class. They countered this with an art that was itself essentially exhibition-and that, which we will come back to (3.2.3), simultaneously announced a certain aspiration to a democratic and public audience: that of the installation. No wonder, then, that "art in public space' not only lost its bad reputation: it became, at least potentially, a matter for what we can confidently still call the artistic avant-garde. No wonder, too, that public institutions-museums and Kunstvereinesoon took on a new mission: to foster contemporary art, especially art that could no longer be conventionally traded as objects.  

Of course, site-specific installation art has not actually overcome the commodity-like character of art by being, even if only to a very limited extent, adaptable to private spaces--although it is true that this would, in fact, amount to their literal domestication. The fact that art can be bought and sold like other things is "the simple consequence of [its] participation in the relations of production."6° Sitespecific art cannot escape these relations; it becomes ideological when it pretends to be able to do so. Secondary products derived from site-specific installations have long been traded on the market, and museums purchase copies (that are site-specific in turn) of works from the early days of site-specific practices, works that, at the time, were considered essentially irreproducible, incapable of transportation, and therefore unmarketable—such as, Serra's Splashing. More over, even when installation artists continue to evade the immediate pressures of the market, they are now confronted with new forms of heteronomy-such as cultural sponsoring by both private and public funds.61 Novel, complex, and ambivalent relations of dependence arise, in part because the most progressive artists, renouncing the traditional art market, have returned to working via commission—which frequently include a tacit request that they adopt a moderately “critical" stance vis-a-vis the patron, be it a private investor, a museum, or the federal government. Now the strength of site-specific art has always been not in pretending to be able to escape the relations of production but in heightening the awareness of these relations and the fault lines associated with them. In this sense, early site-specific art has arguably had a lasting effect by throwing sand—-"procedural complications, ethical dilemmas, and pragmatic headaches,” as Miwon Kwon put itinto the mechanisms of the art business. "They present an unprecedented strain on established patterns of (re)producing,  

exhibiting, borrowing/lending, purchasing/selling, and commissioning/executing artworks in general."62  

In the wake cf institutional critique, the neutral white cube of the gallery was not the only space to forfeit its innocence; the museum did as well. Already at the beginning of the twentieth century, historical avant-gardes considered the museum one of the "central power factors' in the "cultural economy of the modern period" and made it an object of artistic critique.63 But this critique of the museum, framed by the historical avant-gardes as the negation of a bourgeois institution, took a drastically different form in the seventies--and not only because the moment marked a radical change in the institution of the museum, beginning a development that ultimately created the institution as it figures today.° The critique of the museum changed above all because the art of installation. given its site specificity, found itself increasingly dependent on this institution for its realization. Since the seventies, the artistic critique of the museum has therefore been framed no longer from a revolutionary, external standpoint, but quite literally from within.65 Institution-critical art reflects not only on the conventions governing exhibitions or the production of ideology implicit in the rhetoric of exhibition strategies, but also on the national, regional, and/or economic interests that permeate the politics of an institution—-and hence the art it shows. And it does this by (co-)exhibiting the institution and its own practice. Even early institution-critical site-specific works by artists such as Michael Asher, Mel Bochner, Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, Hans Haacke, Gordon MattaClark, and Lawrence Weiner ultimately aimed not so much at being perceived as objects but rather at a reflection on the conditions that traditionally govern the reception of aesthetic objects. Interventions (often installed for a limited time) in the space of the gallery or the museum—more or less discreet intrusions-—-and markings of various kinds sought to render the space of presentation itself and its laws thematic. This always also implied an exhibition of those exhibition techniques that lent traditional works of art the appearance of independence from their context.  

Daniel Buren, for instance, used his signature stripes to mark given features of museum architecture in order to clarify their function as a frame for the traditional work, the boundary between the inside and the outside of an art institution, or certain elements in urban space. In 1970, he writes about his work: \*The new and different contexts in which the work is placed each time little by little reveal the work itself. The practice shows, among other things, that the framework which is each time revealed (the street wall, the Museum/Gallery wall, the billboard, the subways) frames nothing."67 In fact, the relation seems to be reversed in a certain way. Buren's stripe work frames the otherwise invisible frames and exhibits them, making them available for reflection.  

Yet we should not simply dismiss this procedure, as many critics do, as being against “the" autonomy of art. For these works attack not the idea of aesthetic autonomy but merely the objectivist or vestigially metaphysical misconception of it-—-the sort that finds expression in the ideology of art's independence from its context. Buren's works offer resisiance against such a conception of aesthetic autonomy not only by making the traditionally unthematic conditions that frame art explicit in the medium of art but also by reflecting in and by their very form on the constitutive role the viewer plays for the ontology of the work of art. For the works strategically blocksomething every installation does, by the way, in one way or another the impression of totality that invites the ideologies both of selfsufficient independence of context and of self-sufficient independence of the viewer. "The work is focusless, scattered, making it impossible for it to be apprehended as a whole at one glance, when its existence depends e.xclusively on being seen."68 Because they exist only as discreet markings in a space defined by the life-world, be it that of the street or of the gallery, Buren's works refer to the reflective productivity of the subject of aesthetic experience that alone can turn these markings into a work of art, and moreover an institution-critical one. Precisely because the question of what in this context can actually be considered an object is dramatically left open, it becomes evident that Buren's work--as well as its “criticality"-- is only constituted in the context-reflective processes of the aesthetic experience.  

![images/8521d8bbcd1ff1b24845d7ebd882f359b2d78102345d01299b9e4740a647507f.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZXOOsjs.jpeg)  

For it is in no way clear how these stripe marks should actually be understood. Accordingly, it would be a mistake to simply ascribe to Buren's works a certain "institution-critical message. Jean-Francois Lyotard rightly defends Buren against such reductionism:  

When people reproach the work [of Daniel Buren] for being hardly visible and of needing to be accompanied by explanatory texts; when they declare that to read these texts is enough and that it is unnecessary to see the installations; and when some even go so far as to say that the texts in the end only guide the gaze of the addressee just as the operators of the viewing of art did, who this work is meant to critique, they are obviously mistaken. If this work is haraly visible, it is because it does not for its part choose to be seen by means of these same operators but instead because it marks these operators; the latter, however, are hardly visible or invisible, in the sense that they generally serve to let something be seen and not to be seen themselves. There is, then, in Buren's work a sort of paradox-to let the invisible of the visible be seen—that partakes of the Cezannian problematic. But his paradox is visual rather than a matter of language. It consists in letting be seen that which is invisible in the visual field (and in the institution of art in particular), and in doing so by virtue of a simple marking, that of the material. Such a mark, simply by resorting to nothing but the visual sense, does not clearly say what there is to see in that which is usually invisible. It is up to the viewer to say it, that is, to become the addressee of a reflective enunciation.69  

The stripe marks, then, do not in and of themselves convey a critique of the institution; nor, however, can they simply be seen for what they are. “A Buren" is constituted as a work only in the reflection on the open question of what his markings actually mark. In this sense, Buren's markings seem to appear as frames that must first invoke and must continually re-invoke—for the viewer what they frame (the immediate spatial as well as institutional and cultural conditions governing the reception of art).  

That these markings can make room for a zone of reflection on, among other things, the various frames of art is, of course, predicated on a certain knowledge of such frames. Because every aesthetic experience also always consists in a recognition of relations of meaning established by the life-world, a certain art world-specific knowledge of the history of painting, the conventions of exhibition, and the institutions of art comes into play in Buren. Yet the aesthetic experience is fundamentally irreducible to the recognition of these relations. The spaces marked by Buren, insofar as they are experienced aesthetically, time and again withdraw from such disclosures, but only to re-present themselves to be read anew—-as a certain architecture, as a tableau, as wallpapered interiors, as the background for monotonous stripe paintings, as installation, as critical gesture, or as something else. To acknowledge this logic in theory means to abandon any attempt to understand a work completely and as a whole. But that, in turn, means neither that we cannot ultimately say anything about the works—-on the contrary, we should return to the habit of saying more about them—nor even that what is commonly called critical content should be bracketed in favor of formal play. The discipline of philosophical aesthetics has already been misunderstood as an agent of relentless formalism often enough.70 Instead, we must reject the very alternative between formalism and contentism, whose semblance has remained persistent even in the present. We cannot choose between forim and content on the basis of the concept of art I have been explicating. One exists only in conffictual relation to the other. Critics who valorize Buren solely for the formal qualities of his stripe marks obviously misconceive his work, as do those who assess it only according to his theoretical claims. Indeed, to abstract from the critical intention of Buren's work means to make an artificial distinction, one which we should not make. Yet against the reifying immobilization of his works contained in the claim that they are institution-critical--a claim that superficially repeats this intention and is often as general as it is empty--we should be clear about the site of this critique. For the latter is obviously not a given simply by virtue of the stripes. Rather. it is revealed only in the close intertwinement and correspondence between work and viewer: in aesthetic experience. The parergonal logic exhibited by Buren's art of marking makes this particularly evident. Because the markings cannot be read as independent of the situation that they aesthetically make room for, we cannot frame a precise distinction between the work and our interpretation of it (this is structurally the case for all art; the traditional distinction between work and interpretation is in general based on an objectivist misunderstanding). More than that, Buren's work seems to aggressively aim at the viewer's willingness and ability to engage in refection. This is probably also why many traditionalists consider works by Buren and other artists of institutional critique too intellectual—-not because there is nothing to be seen, but because seeing is decidedly deprived of the conventional pretense that the work's form and/or content are evident.  

Yet Buren's worksand not only when they are installed in public spaces-thus illustrate not so much the vulgar Duchampian notion that context (i.e., the institution) ultimately defines what is art,7 but demonstrate instead that aesthetic experience, and with it the possibility of art, can precisely not be institutionally confined: that the institutionalization of art is extraneous to its essence. The objects exhibited in a museum or gallery clearly claim validity as art, but whether or not they live up to this ambition depends on the historically mutable aesthetic experience that is or is not had in engaging with them, as well as on the objectification of such experience in aesthetic discourse.72 By appealing to the specific context-reflectivity of the subject of aesthetic experience in order to be able to develop their critical potehtial, Buren's works demonstrate not that the power to define the aesthetic has devolved, after Duchamp, to institutions of art, but rather, once again, that the artistic avant-gardes rely, with increasing explicitness, on the receiving subject's previous cultural competence and his ability and willingness to engage in reflection.73  

This fact, however, also marks precisely the last limit, the ineluctable frame around the works. Buren himself saw this with perfect clarity. The cultural limit, he writes, "is confining, but it exists, and to reject it (not to take it into account) or to pretend to ignore it is to idealize. [...] In doing so, the cultural limit which allows this discourse, for instance, to take place clearly appears as the background of the work itself (and of all works)."74 Aesthetic experience, as Pierre Bourdieu in particular never tired of emphasizing, is indeed by no means as immediate and universal as the bourgeois ideology of art would like it to be.7s It is based on the interplay of material and symbolic privileges. And this issue has hardly remained unexamined in art. The reflection on the-—-to use Adorno's words-- "culpability of art,76 its complicity with privilege, has shaped the avant-garde from its very beginnings. Artists have always linked their attacks on the prevailing concept of art to the quest for a different audience. This quest, however, generally aimed not merely at a larger audience but simultaneously always also at a qualitatively different way of viewing art than the one associated with art's bourgeois audience: an empty formalist contemplation that ultimately served to reassure the middle classes of their own standing. This is the core of the avant-gardist transcendences of art into life. The institutional critique of the gallery and the museum as institutions of art likewise aimed at this nexus.  

The artistic turn undertaken in the seventies against the false semblance of an independence of the works from their contexts already implied a critical feature, which has been made explicit by feminist, queer. postcolonial, socialist, or subcultural impulses in the art of the nineties: the problematization of an ostensibly disinterested relation toward art. Since this time, art itself has increasingly worked to expose the silent cultural and social assumptions that support its reception and on which——-it is perfectly aware of this-—-it depends. Since the nineties, the term “site specificity" has thus referred less to artistic reflection on the space of the exhibition and its rules, and instead much more to an art that, contrary to the pseudo-neutrality of modern art and the aesthetic experience associated with it, emphatically locates itself in social, cultural, economic, and political contexts. For the second generation of artists working with site specificity and institutional critique active since the late eighties and early nineties, the location of the installation is no longer in itself the central object of artistic reflection. It instead becomes a medium of substantial reference to ausually decidedly extra-aestheticelsewhere.77 The intervention of an installation semantically charges the particular space in which it is presented in such a way that the latter resonates in the aesthetic reflection with the knowledge of political, cultural, and social contexts that lie beyond the sociotope of the art world.  

No other art form today stands more clearly for the development toward a socially engaged art than that of installation. Arthur Danto, for instance, considers it the epitome of an “interested art” polemically directed against the famous Kantian formula of disinterested pleasure. "Installation Art," he writes, “became increasingly the vehicle for artists with particular interests, for the pursuit of which the art was a means."78 Whatever one might think of the reading of the Kantian formula implied by this description of the most recent developments in contemporary art, we should understand even this turn towards an "interested art” as a rejection not so much of the autonomy of aesthetic experience per-se, but rather of a conception of that autonomy, as wrong as it is ideological, that attempts to insulate aesthetic experience against social contents in the name of an ostensible purity of such experience. Precisely in light of this opposition, “interested art” should therefore not be understood (and this is probably also not what Danto meant) as ultimately disavowing itself as art in order to be a mere means for the transmission of (identity-)political or theoretical messages on, for example, social issues. For such an understanding of contemporary art, one that is unfortunately quite widespread, is obviously incapable of describing the complexities of most “interested” installations in the broadest sense, produced by artists such as Fareed Armaly, Monica Bonvicini, Angela Bulloch, Tom Burr, Mark Dion, Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset, Andrea Fraser, Renee Green, Jenny Holzer, Mike Kelley, Christian Philipp Muller, Cady Noland, Adrian Piper, Mathias Poledna, and Stephen Prina. These works are entirely irreducible to the sociological investigations of the museum audience or to an, as the case may be, feminist, queer, postcolonial, sociaist, or subcultural critique of the bourgeois ideology of art. They are neither instances of “discourse analysis,79 as Peter Weibel has prominently opined, nor in and of themselves criticism or politics in a narrow sense. What distinguishes them (as works of art) from all of this is the fact that their meanings are constitutively open. No single definitive context can be identified—either for the works themselves or their individual elements---that could guarantee a conclusive interpretation. As works of art, they remain placeless even and precisely when they relate to their double sitetheir literal and social place. We have seen in the example of Buren's work that the institution-critical potential of his works is disclosed not beyond but precisely only by virtue of the parergonal logic without which the spaces he marks could not be transformed into zones of reflection. This logic, however. applies even in cases where something else is at stake on the level of content---something other than the art business and the conventions of exhibiting. When, for instance, Tom Burr's installation Black Bo.x (1998) appropriates the Minimalist aesthetic and then charges it on the level of content with references to a queer subculture. its political dimension is likewise not directed against its existence as an aesthetic object, but in fact unfolds only in the aesthetic mode: in an experience that, precisely because of the structural openness of the installation situation, reflectively entangles the viewer in the cultural and social conditions that have shaped him.8 That "interested” art today has increasingly turned to matters of identity politics has an additional, I would say, aesthetico-political point--which we will address later. For now, we can note one consequence of the discussion so far: art ought not to attempt to overcome the logic specific to it in favor of direct political statements. For to do so would not only be aesthetically fatal in the long run-—-more than that, it would amount to a self-misapprehension of committed art without any political gain.  

# 3.2. 2. Art and Politics  

In order to assess the potential social relevance of "interested" installation art since the nineties, we should not simply equate this art with specific statements about society. The relevance of a work is not explicated, as Paul de Man noted with regard to literature, by its reference.81 In fact, we should emphasize the difference between "interested’ works and the crude “contentism” so often associated With them.  

The problem of the reduction of particular works to their contents usually arises in the form of reductionist interpretation; but when such reduction is an artist's declared program, it not infrequently also affects the quality of the works. When art, in the name of direct political statements, attempts to reap, as it were, a moral reward for neglecting its formal side (of course, I do not mean simply the motivated neglect of merely beautiful or technically laborious design), it not only reproduces—for the umpteenth time in history—the bad alternative between formalism and “contentism." Rather, by attempting to extort its own importance simply by force of its contents, it risks falling short of the concept of art. Moreover, in most cases, it will also undersell the complexity of the social and/or theoretical problems it seeks to translate. For such illustrative art, in the worst-case scenario, conveys no substance that could not have been understood independently, and in most cases with greater differentiation, in theory. On the contrary, the message that certain materials (whose self-evident meaning such art naively trusts) are meant to transmit usually boils down to the common sense that viewers can be assumed to possess anyway: merely by virtue of its oversimplified content, \*criticism of this sort is preaching to the choir. Art does not become socially relevant by conveying particular content that could be communicated with greater success and precision by omitting \*art-like” decorationas though form were merely an external addition to such content. Art that merits its name never communicates directly. To the extent that objects are at all experienced as aesthetic, as art, they necessarily always also engender their own formalism, a focus on form for its own sake.82 But it would likewise be a misconception to consider this form the proper content of aesthetic experience. Form only constitutes itself as aesthetic insofar as its elements enter a tense relationship with meaning—that is to say, form constitutes itself as aesthetic only insofar as it reflects the process of aesthetic experience playing back and forth between material and meaning. Aesthetic form therefore always has a temporal element to it: it is process, becoming. It would be sub-aesthetically dull to proceed without further ado and read political contents into the material—-as many thematic exhibitions unfortunately suggest to do, tautologically stringing together the most diverse works and reducing them to vehicles of an ever-repeating message that is usually spelled out in full by the superficiality of the keywords in the exhibition title. But by the same token, it is impossible to see the material or the form as such: we are never pure positivists or pure formalists. For perception always already implies meaning, and the latter not infrequently reaches into the political. Art, given the self-reflective and performative structure of the experience of it, cannot be brought to rest either on particular aspects of its form or on particular content, either in material or in meaning. Yet this is not a weakness-—to think so would mean to measure art by the inappropriate standard of direct political efficacy-—-but in fact the specific strength of art.  

Art is socially relevant only according to its own-autonomousprinciple: because its constitutive tension between what is represented and what is representing reflectively energizes all content, such that the ostensible self-evidence of the latter is dissolved by the processual logic of the works experienced as aesthetic even when the artists believe this content to be central. Indeed, the social potential of art resides, I think, in the fact that it disrupts an immediate “"practical impulse\*83 in favor of a reflective distantiation, not in the attempt at political “intervention"—an attempt that is as blind in aesthetic terms as it is, usually, with regard to politics. \*"If for the sake of a higher social truth," as Adorno puts it, "art wants more than the experience that is accessible to it and that it can form, that experience becomes less, and the objective truth that it posits as its measure collapses as a fiction."84 The more art seeks to depict society directly, the more the latter is transmuted into an “"as-if\*8s-- when it attempts "'to hold up a mirror to society,” art indeed not infrequently reverts into cynicism. Art does not accomplish a change in consciousness that might lead to political action because it could somehow inspire moral qualms more directly than, say, any good op-ed article in a newspaper. The structure of the experience of art promises the possibility that it might effect a change in consciousness because it reflectively distances the familiar. “Distance,” as Adorno aptly puts it, “is the primary condition for any closeness to the content of works."86  

The content of the works, however, is not, as Adorno suggested on the basis of his philosophical presuppositions, the distance to society as such, paradoxically attesting to its unreconciled nature as much as tending toward reconciliation. Rather, concrete social content always plays a role in the aesthetic experience of “interested” works in particular. That is why my arguments against a certain penchant for "contentism" in contemporary art and for more "insight into the rationality of the irrationality” of art,87 though they may seem faithful to Adorno, should not be mistaken as arguments in favor of Adorno's aesthetic program and against the political dimension of contemporary art. I neither want to add a new formalist loop to a debate caught up in the false alternative between formalism and contentism, nor do I want to affirm the status quo in art by suspecting anything that smacks of the political as being alien to art. But in alignment with Adorno, my interest is that commitment in art ought not to strive to escape the autonomous logic of the aesthetic. Art ought not to wish to apologize for being constitutively tied to a praxis that cannot be translated directly into action or immediately into cognition. Art enables a specific experience: an experience of distance--an unsettling of any immediate accessibility of the aesthetic object. This distance indeed manifests a certain aloofness of the aesthetic from practical or theoretical aims. If we wish to recognize in this aloofness the “disinterestedness” of aesthetic experience Kant spoke of, however, it would be a structural, not substantial "disinterestedness." Because structure and content cannot be subtracted from experience, it is by no means irrelevant which content enters the denormalizing and defamiliarizing movement of the processes of aesthetic understanding in a given work. Even more: aesthetic experience seems to be able to gain a certain intensity and, hence, quality only when the content that is brought into aesthetic play matters to the subject of experience.  

Yet insofar as the content can never be discovered objectively in the work, the confrontation with "interested” works always also implies one with the silent cultural and social assumptions on the part of the subject of experience itself. In this sense, the fact that “interested' works adapt remarkably often adapt identity-political issues is due not only to certain discursive trends, but also to the artistic opposition to the notion of a universal and neutral subject of aesthetic experience. Contrary to this notion, the “interested” art of our time obviously appeals to each concrete subject. Yet this is precisely why I think that these works teach us something not so much about the social constitution of subjectivity in general, but more about the constitution of aesthetic subjectivity. This is evident especially if we, as I would like to do in closing, consider these works once more in contrast with the discourse of aesthetic modernism, from which the art of installation is so clearly distinct.  

# 3.2. .3. Aesthetic Subjectivity  

To the extent that art is constituted through subjective experience, social content necessarily enters into it, however latent it may be. Works of art and the experience of them do not exist independently of the society in which they have their place. Contemporary installation practice makes this explicit in part by exhibiting the social origins of its subject matter. In this manner, it not only resists the temptation associated with Adorno's project of a theory of reconciliation to anticipate the "non-existent subject”" of a “non-existent  

social whole.\*88 It more generally offers determined resistance against the universalizing temperament of modernist art, whose formalist abstractness obviously seems no less corrupt to today's producers than a formal conception of \*disinterested pleasure." By opening up to concrete social contexts, today's most advanced works appeal to concrete social subjects. Inversely, to the extent that installation art today represses the question of the concrete subject of aesthetic experience, it seems to surrender itself to consumption, degenerating into decorative interior design (as its minimalist predecessors also tended to do).89  

When it takes up this question, however, installation art once again opposes the modernist conception of autonomous art, which ascribes a sort of subjectivity to the work itself. According to a central motif in modernist discourse, art, unlike the commodity, is not for subjects; it is instead itself like a subject --it ought not to be consumed but acknowledged. The various realizations of this motif, however, have shown that modernist discourse responded to the problem of modern subjectivism with what was ultimately an objectivism that denied or marginalized precisely those qualities of works of art and the experience of them that, from the perspective of a non-subjectivist theory of aesthetic experience, merit distinction as specifically aesthetic. Not least because of their opposition to the central ethical-aesthetic motif of modernist discourse, these qualities emerge in a particular way in the art of installation. This art, by highlighting its objecthood in various ways, resists its objectification into a quasi-subject and instead exhibits particular fundamental features of aesthetic experience that had previously been disputed, such as its self-reflective and performative structure, its indefiniteness, and its context-refectivity. As decidedly \*“interested art,” installations now moreover turn against the universalist implication of modernist objectivism, thus forcing the question of the correct conception of aesthetic subjectivity. Before offering a brief sketch, I will recall certain motifs of the modernist definition of aesthetic subjectivity.  

Aesthetic subjectivity is thought of, first and foremost, as the subjectivity of the work of art itself—-that is, as an objective subjectivity of sorts, a subjectivity of decidedly general rather than merely individual validity. According to Adorno's conception (which is more explicit about this point than any other of the modernist discursive positions discussed here), the quasi-subjectivity of the work of art-—unlike the empirical subjectivity of the producing artist it transcends-—-is so objective and general that it can, in principle, be perceived. and hence acknowledged, as such by everyone. The double self-limitation of the artist—his specialized engagement of the “state” of the principles of construction in his art on the one hand, and the subjugation of the corresponding technical rationality to the logic of the material itself on the other--confers, according to Adorno, on his productive force a universality that transcends the individuality of the artist's empirical subjectivity." For Adorno, the artist thus produces art not by expressing, in the manner of the artistic genius, his individual subjectivity, but by transcending it by virtue of self-limitation: by transposing it into the work of art and thus objectifying it. The quasi-subjectivity of art in Adorno is therefore irreducible to the empirical subjectivity of the artist. It is, rather, the imprint and anticipatory illustration of a subjectivity of the supra-individual, that is, of universal validity; it is the imprint of a supra-individual subjectivity by virtue of the doubly objectifying self-limitation of the artist in the process of production; it is the anticipatory illustration of a supra-individual subjectivity in the normative sense Adorno attaches to it. The production of a successful mediation of subject and object, Adorno claims, preserves the utopian idea of a supraindividual true subjectivity in the work of art, that is, a subjectivity liberated from both its own claims to power as well as from selfsubjugation." This renders the “artist" the “"representative of the total social subject."" In accordance with this idea of a utopia of a reconciled humanity dialectically preserved in the work of art, a We, according to Adorno, speaks from the extra-individual subjectivity of autonomous art, and “all the more so the less the artwork adapts externally to a We and its idiom."93  

Yet installation art does obviously precisely that: it addresses various partial publics or at least makes their existence thematic. In a certain regard, we might even say that "interested" installation art positively aims to polarize its audience: “As with all interested art," Danto writes, \*these pieces will of necessity divide spectators."94 Installations whose semantic bodies resonate with issues of identity politics divide the audience along lines of gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, and/or class affliation. Depending on how a recipient is situated in the network of these identity coordinates, he will experience works with feminist, queer, postcolonial, socialist, and/or subcultural motivations in different ways. But that raises the question of what exactly this means for the conception of aesthetic experience, and hence also for the conception of aesthetic subjectivity.  

This dimension of installation art obviously strengthens once again its opposition to the objectivist conception of aesthetic experience as a participatory "being-present-to,” a reconstructing recognition of the quasi-subjectivity that, according to modernist discourse, is the autonomous work of art. For this conception is not only objectivist insofar as it presumes that the mediation performed by the artist of construction and material, of subject and object, can be objectified in the work of art such that the subject of aesthetic experience can perceive it as a quality of the object itself and yet "as if it answered [its] own desires" (VMI, 321). It is problematic because it also presumes that all subjects of aesthetic experience will do so in the same fashion: the subjects convene in aesthetic "being-present-to,” and not only in the sense that in principle everyone has a structurally similar experience (as in Kant), but in a stronger sense---that all subjects convene, as it were, in their subjectivities, aesthetically participating in the anticipatory illustration of the “collective subject." By contrast, committed installation art, with its ability to polarize, aggressively turns against this modernized variant of Schiller's idea of an aesthetically effected unity of mankind.9s  

"Interested" installation art addresses concrete subjects-that is, socially situated individuals. There is a genuinely aesthetic point to this if we do not misconstrue the experience of interested art as a mere experience of identification or counter-identification. Rather, the experience of art, including and especially that of committed art, undermines simple identifications, and places the receiving subject in a self-reflective and performative relation to the object. But this is a relation to the aesthetic object that each subject forms for itself. Aesthetic experience is in an important sense individual-the experiencing subject is compelled to reflect on itself precisely to the degree to which it cannot simply situate itself vis-a-vis the object in terms of identification or counter-identification. The aesthetic experience thus does not transcend the concrete empirical subjectivity of the subject of experience but rather reflects on it in a specific way. This, I think, is an undeniable part of the experience of socially and politically committed works. In such experience, we do not simply receive political messages, rather in the face of specific works, we are confronted in a particular way with our own silent social and cultural assumptions. For in the mode of aesthetic semblance—-as “the dependent that has become independent\*%6 -these assumptions seem to rise most forcefully to the surface of the socially and politically charged works (and it is in this sense, and in this sense only, that the works have the appearance of subjects). Precisely because the meanings that thus appear in the work are never truly warranted by the work, the subject is compelled to reflect on its own productivity in the creation of relations of meaning. Since the receiving subject moreover does not exercise complete control over the subjective powers at work in relation to the aesthetic objects—since the objects seem to “look back” and confront the subject of aesthetic experience with meanings the latter has neither intentionally “made” nor simply objectively discovered in the object--the process thus unleashed on the work may in such cases even lead to a remembrance of the social dimension in all subjectivity.  

The experience of committed art demonstrates quite clearly that we should not misconstrue aesthetic experience as a matter of faculties alone. The reflective confrontation of the subject of aesthetic experience with itself is not the empty self-reflection of an abstract "pure" subjectivity. Rather, the subject experiences itself in relation to the aesthetic object as performative, as generative, but the powers working within it cannot be abstracted from it and objectified as such. Aesthetic experience, in its self-reflective and performative structure, is constitutively related to the aesthetic object, or more precisely, to the process between material and meaning that turns the object into an aesthetic one in the first place. Aesthetic experience can therefore not abstract from this process. What is thus important for this experience is, once more, not only that a process is set in motion but also what this process is being carried out on. Because the object of such a post-Kantian conception of aesthetic experience is more than a mere occasion, because the aesthetic experience cannot, according to this conception, be abstracted from the object and related to its pure performativity, it should also not be reduced to the quasi-philosophical function of assuring us of "ourselves as understanding subjects."97 A complementary objection must be made against the modernist aesthetics of the work. For, surprisingly and symptomatically, what this aesthetics shares with the subject-centered Kantian aesthetic, from whose subjectivism it sought to distance itself, is the impulse to limit the aesthetic experience to an experience, albeit a particular one, of extra-aesthetic subjectivity. The subject experiences itself, according to the Kantian concept of aesthetic experience, as an understanding subject; in the modernist variant, as ethical. The modernist aesthetic of the work indeed differs from the Kantian aesthetic in that it concedes to the aesthetic object primacy over the experience of it. But for both sides—-that of aesthetic subjectivism as well as that of aesthetic objectivism--the defining purpose of aesthetic experience is that the extra-aesthetic subject experiences itself in a particular way, be it in epistemological or ethical terms. Cavell and Fried construct aesthetic experience according to the model of interpersonal relations of recognition not only in imagining the work of art as a quasi-subject, but also in that the self of the subject of experience is called upon to affirm itself in the encounter with that quasi-subject, or at any rate not be "alienated from itself.98 Unlike Cavell and Fried. Adorno always stressed the moment of subjective self-alienation in aesthetic experience." In his Aesthetic Theory, the primacy of the object indeed entails a definition of aesthetic experience as a movement of self-transcendence that comes closer to what I have described, drawing on more recent theories of aesthetic experience, as its specific logic. But Adorno thinks this movement as \*being-present-to." And as such it proves even in Adorno to be a particular experience of extra-aesthetic subjectivity, albeit of a second-order subjectivity: by sublating itself as empirical subject in the participatory-reconstructing recognition of the quasi-subjectivity of the work of art, the subject of aesthetic experience participates in the anticipatory illustration of the true, liberated form of subjectivity at large.  

Modernist and Kantian discourses alike ultimately reduce aesthetic experience to an experience of extra-aesthetic subjectivity, albeit a particular one, and in so doing, marginalize its specific logic. This logic-—and, hence, the autonomy of the aesthetic vis-a-vis the spheres of theoretical and practical reason—becomes visible, I think, only if we avoid both the subjectivist and the objectivist misunderstanding of aesthetic experience, and do not reduce the object of aesthetic experience to the mere occasion for such experience nor reify it into a quasi-subject. Only then can aesthetic subjectivity emerge-—namely as the specifically reflective form the subject takes in and as the moment of the aesthetic process that unfoids between itself and the object. The subject that is an aesthetic subject in this sense experiences itself not in performative faculties that it already (potentially) has outside the realm of the aesthetic, but in a specific form of reflectivity it gains in aesthetic experience only.1o Due to the self-reflective performative logic specific to this experience, the aesthetic subject can then also no longer serve as a model for extra-aesthetic subjectivity. It is instead inevitably partial, for aesthetic experience is an autonomous third besides the spheres of theoretical and practical reason. Aesthetic experience does not transcend the subjectivity of empirical subjects, but is instead one of their essential possibilities. Unlike Adorno, I do not believe that aesthetic experience sublates empirical subjectivity in a presumptive objectivity of the work. The aesthetically distanced relation to the object does not take “the recipient qua empirical psychological person out of action, which benefits his relation to the work."101 Instead, as I hope to have shown, aesthetic experience is an experience of giving oneself over to the "substance” of the concrete that is not sublated in an objectivity that is, as it were, a second-order subjectivity. The specifically object-related self-reflective Gestalt the subject takes on in aesthetic experience, as conceived in such post-Kantian terms, is the epitome neither of a subjectivity emancipated toward truth nor of one emancipated toward ethics. It is, rather, the site of an aesthetic operation of reflection that is neither reducible to theoretical nor practical reason. That this is precisely the point of aesthetic experience is probably especially evident when the content entering into the reflective play of aesthetic experience is of extra-aesthetic import to the subject.  

With the recognition of the sociopolitical commitment of contemporary art, one could object to the conception of aesthetic experience I have advocated in that it virtually individualizes, and thus depoliti cizes, aesthetic experience. But aesthetic experience in the sense I have advocated is by no means reducible to a private experience (Erlebnis). For the notion of aesthetic experience I have presented is distinguished, and in this respect it is not so much post-Kantian as it is Kantian, from mere subjective experience (Erlebnis) by its implicit relation to art-critical judgment and therefore to public discourse.102 This relation simultaneously establishes an implicit relation between a constitutively individual aesthetic experience and sensus communis. An aesthetic We can be constituted in public aesthetic discourse Only. But that also means: this We is constitutively contentious.103 Installation art, in this context, lays greater claim to a public audience by virtue of its site-specific form while increasingly problematizing the idea of the public sphere by virtue of its “interested” content. In calling for a public, installation art thus also calls on precisely this public to emancipate the idea that "art is for everyone” from its bourgeois, immobilized, cliche misreading. In this sense, the progress in aesthetic enlightenment the present book has claimed as an achievement of some traits of installation art may also represent a contribution to political enlightenment. Art affects society, if it does so at all, not because the experience constitutes "something on the order of a collective subject,"1o+ but because it can confront the subject with the social dimension of its own subjectivity. The fact that this leads to different experiences for differently situated social subjects may also be reflected in a politicization of aesthetic discourse. To the extent that aesthetic experience is permeated by relations of meaning that belong to the lifeworld and extend into the political dimension, aesthetic discourse, like the experience it objectifies, is constitutively impure. Accordingly, the discourses of practical and theoretical reason will also time and again offer their own perspectives on it. Such interventions are an essential part of art criticism today—and justifiably so.  

In the modernist view, art, as the locus of utopia, stands in stark contrast with an instrumental reason that has presumably become total. Contrary to this view, it is precisely because of its interest in political utopias that installation art points beyond itself to spheres of moralpractical and theoretical-scientific reason in which alone such a utopia could become concrete. The committed art of our time thus preserves not so much the abstract utopia of reconciled humanity but rather the enlightened awareness that the realization of such a utopia would take more than art and the experience of it.

In recent years, discourse surrounding the concept of art has focused in particular on installation art, as its diverse manifestations have proven to be incompatible with the moderm idea of aesthetic autonomy. Defenders of aesthetic modermism repudiated installation-based work as no longer autonomous art, whereas advocates of aesthetic postmodernism abandoned the concept of aesthetic autonomy altogether. Juliane Rebentisch asserts that installationart does not, as is often assumed, dispute aesthetic autonomy per se, and rather should be understood as calling for a fundamental revision of this very concept. Aesthetics of Installation Art thus proposes a new understanding of art as well as ofits ethical and political dimension.  

Aesthetics of Installation Art will rejuvenate and irrevocably change debates about the nature of aesthetic experience, the autonomy of art, modernism and postmcdernism, and, through all of these, about installation art certainly, in Juliane Rebentisch's expanded definition of the genre, the most important fomm of art since the 1960s.  

Douglas Crimp  

Juliane Rebentisch's study of the philosophical underpinnings of installation art brilliantly reevaluates the concept of aesthetic autonomy as the very condition of the possibility of "art" itself. With captivating readings of Martin Heidegger, Theodor W. Adorno, Clement Greenberg, Rosalind E. Krauss, Jacques Derrida, Stanley Cavell, and others, Aesthetics of Instaltation Art pushes debates about "site specificity” and “Institutional Critique" to argue that aesthetic autonomy and the public sphere in installation art are, in fact, inseparable.
