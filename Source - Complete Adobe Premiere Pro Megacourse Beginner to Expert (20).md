## 20 Advanced Techniques
### 1. Introduction to Advanced Techniques

Well done.
You got this far.
I'm pretty sure this is the first time you've seen this face.
So apologies.
We should have put a warning up.
So, first and foremost.
Well done.
Congratulations.
You've got through the basics.
And yeah, you'd be right to think that there are a lot of the premiere pro.
However, we're now going to push further.
And the reason why I am talking to you now is because rather than just a static screen, I just want
to explain why it's going to be the way it is from this point.
Open to this point, you've been using footage that you that you have been supplied by us.
However, from this point on, we won't be supplying the footage.
And there's two main reasons.
Firstly, that a lot of it is going to be me because we're going to be talking well, some of it is
going to be me as a talking head, because I'll be showing you different tips and tricks with regards
to editing, talking head, video.
And secondly, as I touched on earlier in this course, I am a professional videographer and I have
clients and some of the footage that I'm going to be using will also be client footage.
Actually, there's three reasons and my clients, I haven't got the sign up from my clients, although
it's my footage because the deliverables are theirs and the footage is mine.
My, my footage is not being licensed for this series.
Finally, some of the footage that we're going to be using will be stock footage.
And although I have a licence to use it, I don't have a license to distribute it.
Now, in those occasions, the stock footage that I'll be getting will be from the motion or a plugin
within Premiere Pro.
If you haven't downloaded the plug ins, there's no pressure.
You don't have to.
I know that the premiere the premiere composer from Mr. Horse is completely free for starts back at
times motion where he may be running similar but have a look on their website.
Links are on the worksheet that you've been provided with this course.
So what are we doing from here on in?
Well, it's it's the that I kind of like to see as the the real the specialist tools.
If you imagine you've got your tool kit and you've got your, you know, your spanner and your hammer
and your nails and your screwdriver and your drill.
And that's what you've got right now.
You've got the basic tool kit.
But what we're going to be building on now is with other special tools, like maybe a spirit level or
a second guy, it's going to help me.
I don't know.
I'm not very good at tools, but we're now building on your knowledge with loads of different techniques
for editing, whether it be audio or video, visual with graphics and all that.
So from here on in, we're going to have a selection of absolute bangers and they're all going to be
pretty much standalone and standalone little tips and tricks.
Some of them are going to be short, some of them are going to be stupidly long.
One thing I am going to say is that there will be elements of after effects in this, and I just want
to qualify that because after effects, I've mentioned it before.
If you remember, there have been some motion graphics templates in the in the earlier parts of this
course that have required after effects to be installed in the computer, not necessarily opened just
to be able to have premiere pro reading that motion graphics template.
So you should really have after effects installed anyway.
Regardless, if you don't and you don't have the suite, I would advise maybe getting a trial of of
after effects, but seriously, it works out pretty much the same once you use more than one program.
And I highly recommend you having all the programs as in the suite purely because there are certain
things where you'll need maybe Illustrator not in this course, but in Illustrator or you may need after
effects you're going to need or maybe even Photoshop.
There are so many techniques that work across the whole of this suite and that's using something called
Dynamic Link.
And we're going to be embracing that as well going on because you can't, in my opinion, for what it's
worth, but I have been in this industry for many years now, but in my opinion, a good videographer
at least needs a basic grasp of after effects.
It's been required from so many in-house jobs these days, just even knowledge of motion graphics.
And we're going to be I'm not going to be giving you the whole spiel on after effects like I've done
with Premiere Pro, but I will show you how to use it with the areas that we're going to be using it,
if that makes sense.
So that's it.
My name's Adam, by the way, and this is my cave.
This is why I.
From this is a converted garage and that chair normally has my wife in it.
If you've had any sniffles or any coughs in the background, I think I got it all out in the in the
audio, but my wife's not been to well at the moment, which is why she's banished today because she
didn't want to be on camera.
But also I couldn't have her sniffing and coughing and all the way through that.
You don't want that.
So bless her.
She's inside with a cup of cocoa and her laptop on her knee.
So, yeah, without further ado, let's get on with it.


### 2. Cut Out Text

So welcome to the first of the advanced technique.
It's going to starts out with a little kind of an easy one to start out, and that's cut out text.
So I've loaded up a recent client video that I've made and let me I just tell them that as you can see,
that's quite the edit.
This is a music video for a an upcoming artist in the UK called Scott Comanche.
He's brilliant, he's absolutely wild.
And some of the ideas he has are just, yeah, he comes to us and he's like, I'm looking for this.
There's this thing like, Right, how are we going to make that work?
Give you a little bit of a smattering of him.
Yeah.
So he wanted to start in his hot tub with his dog.
He's called Dave the dog gorgeous.
He's called Scott Comanche because he has Native American heritage.
I'll just show you something very quick.
Look at these keyframes here.
So we started on this little bit with him.
Zoomed in and zoomed it out.
Let me play it back.
That was just a little bit, too, to reveal the horse that we're actually going to emulate, something
that is in this scene where he's in a boxing ring getting getting beaten up, as it were.
Is.
Do.
And that's that we're looking for the sons called Forrest Gump folk.
And I do what I want now.
It's all very much the fact that he just lets it does what he wants.
That's his character.
And we're going to emulate desperate.
If you look at this text graphic here.
It was just a really good way to just just break it up a little bit before we moved on, because once
he's been in there, we then went all the way out and just all of a sudden
he's on quad bikes.
And it just it's such a fun video.
If you if you're that way inclined, have a look for Forrest Gump funk and a little shout out to him
because he's brilliant.
And those are his are his socials.
We used a premiere composer with a lot of this to bring up the text, play that end.
Oh, we used funk and that, but black and white of it.
All this was done in just a little click click send primary composer.
Brilliant.
As I said earlier in the course, I use a lot of these techniques professionally all the time.
So anyway, let's get to the funk, but that's what I want to emulate.
So let's open up our own edit and let's carry on.
And here we are, back in our own edits.
But yeah.
Okay.
It seems a little bit more sedate after a little bit has got Comanche.
So what we need is some video so we can put some text on top.
And rather than using over stuff, let's.
Let's jump into motion.
Right.
And see what stock footage we can get.
And I'm thinking maybe.
Oh, that looks quite nice.
What's nice?
Just mute that for now and play that back.
Quite, quite nice.
Where is that?
Aerial view.
Of what?
I'd love it if this is a bit bigger.
Shall we?
Tilt without aerial view of an autumn forest.
Well, we could do that and bring up the word forest.
That be quite good.
Yeah, let's get that.
Okay, so we're now downloading it and it will download the video and then it will be imported over
to here into the motion array area.
Obviously, we've got the cooking with the smile and the the preparing homemade pizza there.
That's a typo and.
Right.
Yeah, that's in good.
I haven't spoken about picking on that quickly.
Now, as you can see, this is aerial view of an autumn forest.
We can see is actually 29.97 frames per second.
But that's no problem.
Premier just deals with it.
It's great like that.
And this is also if we mouse over that up to a 4K 3840 by 2160, that's fine.
It's 4K footage, but it will place it in there at the right size and yet it's set to scale 50% if you
have any problems with regards to that and scaling sizes and all that.
If you right click and set to scale, set to frame size, you don't want to scale to frame size, just
always set to frame size.
I think I've touched on that before, but just in case I haven't.
Right.
So let's have a quick look at this video.
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Right.
So we're going to put some text over here.
And what we want is we want to just have this being seen in the text.
So let's write some text.
So quite simply, we grab the title and click and I'm just going to write fast.
Don't worry about the size of the text for now.
How do you spell forest?
Is it just wana?
I think it is to us.
Is Forrest Gump is that Forrest Gump funk?
There you go.
It's all meant to be.
And okay, so this is obeying the last piece of text that I was playing with in here.
So it's impact.
It's actually in the forest funk of planet about before.
So first and foremost, I want to center it so that centered alignment.
I also want to center in the screen and go for middle as well.
So it's top and bottom.
Now it's we're a little bit squashed up, so I'm actually going to put that to zero.
Good.
That's fine by me.
And yeah, I'm just going to scale this down a little bit, not too much, because I want to check what
font I want to use.
It's always good when you do stuff like this, you properly get that.
You get the right font style that you want to be able to cut out, and the best is something kind of
chunky.
So I'll say something like interstates, it's not really chunky enough.
Impact is a really good one for that.
But if we scale, if we scroll down and have a look, no esta no s is actually good for that.
It's quite yeah.
Let's use something else purely because we've used that a lot and that's not right.
I want something quite.
I don't know, quite, quite simple, but effective.
Tree.
No, that's.
That's not good.
You know what?
I'm going to go with another one of my favorites.
And that's next about I'm going to do all caps.
And you see how it was best to just get the font that we want first before we.
Yeah.
Before we start to move it around and.
Good.
Happy with that.
So I'm going to go back to my selection, Kate, and let's just track this up for the whole of the clip
first.
Good.
So we have our text and we have our.
Forest behind it.
Good.
So what we do now is we want to go into our facts and we're actually going to be searching for something
that is quite prevalent in after effects, what it's called, it's called a track mat, and that is
track mat key.
And Mat, as you can see, is m a double t like our collar Matt that we go on here and the track and
the key kind of explain what happened.
So track is to track something.
So you're tracking something.
So something will be reading from something else.
And key is very similar to the likes of Color Key.
So you know, like Chroma Key when you do something on a white on a green background and then you take
that all out, that's called cloaking.
And yeah, that's what that is doing.
So what we're going to do is going to drag this and we're going to track this onto the video clip.
Okay.
Nothing's happened just yet because we need to tell it what to do.
So as you can see, we've in our effects controls, we have our track, Matt Key right here and Matt
is Alpha.
Now what we want to do is we want to tell the Matt what to read from now.
The video clip, which is where we're here, is video one, but the text is video too.
So you drop down and you say, I want to read from video to and all of a sudden straightaway, boom,
done.
So if we play that back now, the video is being read.
Just through that text.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Now what we can do.
I mean, that's it.
Don't.
What we can do is we can kind of make this a little bit more, I don't know, maybe a little bit more
interesting.
So what we what I want to do is I want to scale up.
I say that's not going quite right because it's reading, but that's okay.
But it's not getting to what I want to do.
What I want to do is because this video is flying, I want to fly through this and out into the forest.
So rather than using vector motions, what we're going to do is we're going to put a simple, basic
3D perspective on here and I'll show you why.
So now we've got our text on this section and in the effects controls, we've got nothing really other
than the basic 3D.
Remember the track map keys on the video below?
Okay, so what we're going to play with is we're going to play with distance to image and maybe a little
bit of positioning, but we shall see.
So let's play that through.
And as you can see, the video is playing behind the text and only coming through the text.
I love this effect and it can be used really well to establish something at the beginning of a video
or to to show a change in in location.
Just clear this up.
I've just restarted my system.
So, yeah, we like that.
Now, what I want to do is I want to make this a little bit more I don't know, it's a little bit more
interesting just looking at that as we move that kind of we tilt on the actual footage.
Can you see that?
If I just get rid of that for now?
At this point, we kind of tilt off when we look down into the forest.
So at that point, what I want to do, by the way, my shortcut for enabling and disabling tracks is
zero on my number pad.
So at that point, I want to reveal everything.
Now, what I could do is I could pull this back, add a little.
Fade out and it doesn't really work.
And that's because of the tracking that we're doing.
So fading doesn't quite work.
However, the reason why we've added the basic 3D, which is over here, is to to animate and come in
through the text in the scene in a number of things, maybe some Hollywood films and stuff, and that's
what we're going to do.
So that's why we've added the basic 3D and in the distance, the image.
If we start playing around with that, which is what we're going to be affecting, it doesn't really
do anything.
Why is that?
That is because if you look in the essential graphics, basic 3D is under the text.
Okay.
So if we grab this basic 3D and put it above the text, everything affects everything below.
So if we now start doing it.
Well, I go where further because the actual number is higher.
So that's further away from the text.
If we reset that and bring it in and let go, there we are.
It's it's a bit annoying, but it's, it's a little bug in the system that it doesn't kind of hold on,
you've got to kind of affect the number and then let go.
So as long as you know that, it's fine.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this back a little bit.
And by the way, bear in mind that you can still keep your position.
The reason why I say that is because we're going to turn on a key frame for both position and distance
to image, just in case if we get really close and we need to move the position ever so slightly.
So if we move this up a little bit.
I don't let go.
We just a little bit further on and we're just going to start to track this down and keep letting go.
That looks about right.
That's why we kind of where we want to be.
Let me just undo that for now.
Let's try and come through here.
Right in the E that looks somethin at least close to center where we want to come through.
So if I start dragging that down, I've gone far too far.
Uh, let's go about the quick getting there somewhat.
It's very much.
Try to narrow this.
Let go.
Okay.
We've got upside down now, so.
Okay.
How does that look?
We are upside down again.
Okay, so let's drag it off to the side a little bit.
Could we get in there?
I just need to cone kind of keep playing with this to try and get to where we want.
Okay, that looks like it's where we want.
That's at minus one or two.
Let's go to -100 and check.
Okay.
Let's go to.
-98.
I can't see anything.
Go again.
-95.
Okay.
We just got a little bit there.
So let's go to -96.
Yeah, we're out.
Think?
Is that a little.
I think that's a little bit better.
Let's go to -96.5.
Hit Enter.
Looking at the left hand side of the frame and we're out.
Cool.
So that's what we want.
So I'm going to keyframe these right click and, you know, ease out.
Uh, and easy.
A lot of videographers and editors do Basia and all that.
I like to have full control.
Let's play that back and see how that goes.
Could you see how that works?
Nice.
I think it goes a little bit too fast.
So I'm going to bring this back and let's take this first handle, come all the way back and let's start
it and see how it works.
And we then start to slowly grow through.
Here we go into.
The forest just as we start to tilt down and look good.
I like it.
It's good.
What I want to change.
Well, first and foremost, I do want to put a fader.
But how do I do that?
Well, we're not fading the text because the text is now a matte.
Although it can be edited, it's now a matte.
So what we want to do is we want to fade the video before it or below it.
Even so that highlight those handles and just shift.
And now if I press play.
Hmm.
And because it's slow, I'm going to give it a slow fade.
So let's bring it back and play that back.
Forest.
I like this looks really good.
And then we start to slowly fade in.
Right through.
And then we're established.
I see.
Because we've got this clip.
So you're using other clips.
This is a bit of a book with motion right at the moment.
You need to close it and then open it again and then it kind of comes back.
But let's go.
Let's look for Forest again and.
You could get some more.
Clips.
You say that one's done.
That's good.
Is that another?
That's over the top.
Okay.
I think that that looks like the same colors as this.
So let's get that downloaded.
And this is just to show you how this works with more than one clip in, as much as the reason why you're
using it and why you're bringing in this effect and how it would establish what you're looking to do.
Say you're on your your your travel vlog and this is the kind of thing that you're doing.
Yeah.
Getting a second clip in there will show you just how we establish all that is not putting it into there
as well as that.
Okay.
So we are downloading my downloads named that and so that was set to import in wants it downloaded.
So now we're coming in importing files and I'm guessing that's probably our next clip.
Good.
Cool.
So let's grab that and drag that into the timeline as well and as we come through.
That's established if we then bring this in.
I'm just overwriting as we go and we play the whole thing through.
Let's just give you a nice quick pre render so we can give you at full resolution and you know, me
clear in and out because it just affects me.
It just it upsets my eyes and play out through.
So we now have that text with the track Matt cutting through and only reading the video below it and
as we then animate through.
We establish everything.
And then we cut to the next bit.
And that is such a simple way to cut out text in your video, and you can have so many ways to use this.
And by the way, don't forget, you don't necessarily have to grow in you know, you don't have to zoom
it in, like with like we've done.
You could do anything you like.
You could.
You could get rid of the distance to image.
Better leave out there.
You could get rid of the position key framing.
And what we could do is we could set a key frame there and have that all the way to the beginning and
maybe move it a little bit.
I really hope that they get rid of this bug
that's created and you keyframe a move up there and then move it to the end and move it over there.
And it could just be a simple.
Passing through it.
You can keyframe this however you wish.
That basic 3D is a really important one to remember because it just it just works better with the quality
output.
If you were to scale, we could quite possibly have anti-aliasing when we touched that earlier on the
course.
And you've got like jagged edges all the way around also.
I mean, you can play with the tilt and the swivel.
I love the swivel in basic 3D.
So you could get rid of that position, keyframe refresh that into the middle and you could start at
-88 and let's just for ease, got a plus 88.
Pull that out at spec's specular highlights.
And as we play that through, we might need to pre render it because Premiere Pro just hates me right
now.
But as you can see, it's not a massively CPU intensive effect.
And effectively where we've got two effects on here, we've got the track and we've got the basic 3D
swivel, but.
Just in that little thing we can.
We've we've.
We've got.
It's perfect, you know.
That could be the way that you're looking to to to introduce it or start just that there's we saw that
there we get rid of that key frame.
Now if we Adichie frame and get rid of that key frame and this key frame we go to reset.
We could again if we need to pre render in and out and play that back.
We just start a little bit off the side.
And then, of course, these are linear.
So just starts and stops.
But this could give you the.
Nice way of bringing in.
I mean, I prefer the first time, but just to show you the different ways in which we can use this
cut out text when used properly and sparingly, it's it's a great technique and it's used right the
way through the industry.


### 3. Flip & Advanced Rotation

So flip and advanced rotation.
So you can do most things in effects controls like we've we've used so many times we know how to rotate.
We have the clip selected and then we just use the rotation to move it around.
However, the advanced bit of rotation to draw your attention to is that you don't necessarily have
to be rotating around the center.
If we highlight motions, we highlight our boundaries.
Obviously, we've got our anchor point.
We've talked about that before in an earlier section.
But what you can do is you can move this anchor point anywhere that you like, say, up here, and you
can rotate around that anchor point, see how it's rotating from around here.
All the footage, by the way, in this section is from motion, right?
Don't forget, there's a link in your worksheet to be able to get to them.
And I just I can't believe how much stuff they have here.
I mean, literally, they've got footage on anything, not just video, but photo.
And yeah, you know, they deal with motion, right?
So we.
So that's how you rotate around another point that's not necessarily centered.
Now, if I click out, you can still rotate around, but you just can't see where that anchor point
is.
If we want to reset everything as we now just reset and reset everything, that's actually set all the
way down to the bottom because our anchor point is kind of still not on.
So let's reset everything.
Well, do another good.
So that's how to rotate around somewhere that's not necessarily center.
Now, let's say that we want to actually rotate this because we want to level the horizon.
As you can see, the horizon isn't there.
Oh, it's not level.
So how do we make sure that we know what level is?
Well, remember, we've got our safeguard, the safe boundaries here, and actually we could use that,
but there's a way to get it a little bit cleaner.
We have the show gauge member.
If these aren't showing up, you got to here and you can drag down what you need.
What I'm also going to do is I'm going to drag down show rulers for this section.
And actually, that should always really be on there because it's it's brilliant.
So if I show my guides, I actually have set up these guides.
But if they're not there for you, if you show rulers, let me just drag these out, you'll probably
be able to tell now how to do that in reverse.
And quite often I use this to absolutely dial in the very center of a screen.
And the way in which I do this is I bring on my safe guides.
And because I've got rulers on here, I bring up my mouse.
This originally started in Photoshop.
This has only been brought into premiere pro of late and it's just it's changed the game really it helps
so much let me just Tilde this to make it a little bit because you can see it properly and if I move
my mouse up into the ruler, which is the horizontal ruler of the x axis, I can just drag down and
it drags me down.
A guide now that's come in purple.
But you can change the color.
I quite like a cyan color.
So any guide you just right click when you've got the mouse over and edit guide and you can change the
color, the position and you I mean you can see change everything.
But what I like to do is I like kind of that color.
We don't have to make it broadcast friendly because it's not going to be viewed anyway and just hit.
Okay, good.
Now we can convert that into a horizontal vertical if we want and press.
Okay, but it just kind of places it anywhere that you like.
So I'm going to drag that there.
Go on.
I wish it snap, but it doesn't.
I just bring that into center.
So that gives me my absolute center point.
But that doesn't help this because we're looking down here.
We can either drag another guy down or we can just drag this one down where we want it.
So that's the top of the horizon.
That's the bottom of horizons.
What want to do is I'm going to get somewhere near the middle tilde out and with the clip selected,
I'm just going to use the rotation and drag it one way or the other to get that level that looks kind
of no, it doesn't have a look.
I move the guide around got to kind of allow for kind of like shrubbery and all that, but that's definitely
a much more level horizon, is it?
Not quite.
So I'm going to use the anchor point and if I highlight motion my anchor point, I'm going to grab the
anchor point and I'm going to place that right here.
Now if I tilde NC You can see that that's pretty much on the horizon.
It's a little bit lower, but I now want to rotate around this anchor point.
So if I tell the back out again and.
Our rotate.
As you can see, I'm rotating around there, so that will help me to dial it in.
He says it's a very, very circle.
The numbers, we're minus three.
I want to go a little bit more that way, don't I?
So I want to go more plus.
So if I type in minus three again, that's where we were, maybe minus two.
Little bit better, maybe -2.5.
Bring it back a little bit, not -25, -2.5 and let's tilt it and then see, that's much more level.
Me Just get rid of the guides and the boundaries for now so you can see.
So what that then does is it kind of gives us well space where there's no, there's no footage.
So what we can then do is we can use the scales, we can either drag up on the number or, you know,
I like a slider, so we could just slide that up.
But the problem is, is that when now we're scaling up from the anchor point.
So what we then do is we need to re move, move again, not remove the anchor point, but if we reset
it, it kind of ruins everything.
So what we then need to do is if we go to the safe margins again, grab that anchor point and just move
it where we want to.
If you hold down control, you can snap it to center.
So now we're going to size up again around center.
And I want to do that because there's bits of here and there's bits down there and there's bits here.
So if we size it from center and up here, I see a little bit of block there, so we'll try and fill
out all that.
So if we leave the boundaries until we know exactly where those blue lines are, let's just scale up
slowly and okay, everywhere is going to pop from the top left.
So just a little bit more.
And they have it.
We now have a level horizon.
We've got a little bit of wiggle room.
Very, very little.
So that's there.
So we've got a now a nice level horizon.
And for me, that's much more aesthetically pleasing than if I create another one.
Remember, hold down alt and drag to and let go.
You bounce before you let go of alt to make a new version.
If we reset everything back to where it was.
That if I just.
Trim that out so we can see them.
But that is with the horizon kind of off.
And as we play on the clip below, that's with the horizon just leveled off.
It's not necessarily much of a change in here.
It would be in this, again, promotional rate.
You quite often get drone footage and the horizon isn't quite right.
Sometimes it doesn't look quite right, but it is sometimes with a fish islands or something.
So what we can do is we can bring on our guides and check and yeah, the horizon isn't quite right.
You see how it's like there.
The thing is, this is a moving drone shot, but because the drone is panning down with the camera and
only straight down, it's not changing the goal, which is kind of the rotation.
If you tilt your head left or right, that's your way.
W It's not changing that.
So the horizon is still off.
So I'm going to track this up to here just on this clip, and I'm going to use exactly just what we've
learned.
So I'm going to get the anchor point.
I'm going to grab the anchor point making sure that you grabbing the guide and moving that off.
But no, not that there grab the anchor point.
I'm actually going to place that this edge of the horizon and then I'm just going to grab rotation and
I'm going to move it to the right.
That's far too much.
You do have to get it kind of going a little bit and that's only a rotation.
I'm going to use the numbers.
Let's go rotation to.
Bring down the guide.
See how that is?
Yeah, that's pretty much spot on.
Now you can see that because we've rotated around the anchor point and we've moved the anchor point
that's now kind of brought it down from the top.
And I bring that anchor point and I'm going to move it back to the center, and then I'm going to position
this a little bit more.
So I'm going to kind of bring it up a little bit, maybe bring it over to the left a little bit.
So I've kind of got I've got space that needs to be filled on all four sides that kind of makes it just
more equal.
Once I then start to scale up, so we just starts going up just ever so slightly come in there, that's
enough.
Get rid of the guides.
And if I play that through.
Once again, I'm going to make a second copy and track that back.
I'm going to reset all of these.
We see everything, even the anchor point.
Yeah.
And just play this through and you'll see the difference.
That just, you know, should have been done in-camera.
To be honest with you, the drone the drone operator should have calibrated the gimbal.
But sometimes that doesn't happen and you don't.
I'm a drone pilot as well.
So sometimes you don't necessarily notice it's it's off until you get the footage into the computer.
This, again, is a great case for shooting 4K footage and outputting intensity because we've zoomed
in by about 8%, 8.3%.
But you're not going to lose any quality when you output the intensity because the footage is 4K.
So it's downscaling and you won't lose any quality.
Now, Flip.
It's kind of still within this this kind of area.
And there's two ways to flip.
There's a quick way and there's a slow way.
But if you're using and dialing numbers in doesn't really slow you down.
So to flip this, we just want to rotate so we could go rotate 180 boom done to our data.
How about if we want to flip it horizontally?
This is a vertical flip.
If we want to flip it horizontally.
Now, if we flip it horizontally, obviously the numbers are going to be kind of backwards and stuff.
But let's undo that and flip horizontally.
There's a very there's a long way and a sure way.
The quickest way is to go into your effects area and tape flip.
Now in there, we do have the vertical flip.
That's the quick way to just been done and all that.
And all it does is it doesn't actually do anything with your rotation.
It actually chucks on a transform effect, which can't really be edited because that's all it does.
Vertical flip.
And that's how it works.
But if we want it to horizontal flip.
It's just as easy as the vertical flip.
They can't really tell that much here because we're upside down.
But if I undo.
And sometimes we do control shift said to redo and controls that to undo.
Sometimes that makes the difference because sometimes you want to put a bit of text maybe down here
like a lower third.
And it doesn't quite work with this because it's still a little bit busy.
Well, if it's just a short clip, chuck it on a horizontal flip and you'll often there is a way to
do this manually with regards to uniform scale.
But if I if I toggle off uniform scale, you'll see we're starting to play 50 height and 100 width and
the aspect ratio isn't kept in after effects.
It does kind of it obeys a slightly different law.
It doesn't really work in, in premiere pro, so I'm not even going to take you down that path.
So what I want to show you now is it's kind of within the same paradigm as it were of rotation and flipping,
but it's actually how to show maybe like a screen recording and a little bit of a better way.
And to do this, I'm going to drag in a bit of footage from a client video I've done quite recently,
and this is just a standard screen recording and this was kind of showing is bottle shop.
He does a private wine tastings, he also has a bottle shop.
So I'm going to set in there and maybe just, okay, let's take it back a little bit while I was scrolling
and out and I drank in that footage.
Cool.
So what we do is first and foremost, I've got a little bit around the edges that I don't really want
in.
I could crop these, but the easy way to do it would be to scale up.
Until that's hidden.
Good.
Happy that.
Maybe.
Maybe bring it up a little bit so I don't have that weight at the top.
Good.
That'll do.
And I'm going to nest this first.
And the reason why I'm going to nest it is because, as you see, the position is different than standard.
It should be 960, 540.
The scale is different.
90.5.
And I want to kind of start with standardized.
So 100% scale and 960 by 540.
So if I nest it press and on the keyboard and hit okay, I'm not going to rename it if I highlighted
again we're back to 960 by 540 and if I move this round.
That's the only bit I've got if I scale it down.
So it's kind of like baked in in after effects is called as it's referred to as a pre comp or a pre
composition.
But that's kind of what we're doing.
We've pre composed it, we've nested this.
So it works like that.
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to come back over to my effects and I'm going to go to it's
actually a 3D effect.
But if I we've used it before and a low drop on basic 3D.
Now, what does that do?
Well, we've seen before with text, we've got tilt and swivel and all that and distance to image and
that's what we're going to play with.
So if I take a distance and pull it out, ignore the black around here at the moment, we're going to
change that.
And if I tilt, I'm going to tilt it forward.
No, I tilted back a little bit and maybe put a bit of a swivel on it.
So we kind of give it a better perspective.
Good.
Happy with that so far?
Good.
Now we're going to scale it up a little bit more, but I still have this black in the background and
I kind of want a bit of space.
So I'll and do this, I'm going to bring that nested sequence up one and I'm going to right click in
here and create a color map.
I mean, this is personal preference, but this is kind of what I always do.
Going to set the column up to white.
It's okay.
Yeah, okay.
And drag that underneath this clip and make it for the duration.
So now we've got a white background rather than a black.
It's just nicer.
We're also going to place this in a space.
But first and foremost, I'm going to add specular highlight.
You see how that gives a highlight on there.
And it's almost like a light is being shone on it and you can't really tell how much of a difference.
If I toggle off, you can say I'm going to leave that on for a reason and I'll show you that very shortly.
Now, what we can do is going to keyframe this.
We're going to keyframe the swivel.
So if I come right back to the beginning and I'm going to.
Seth keyframe there because with 23 plus 23 degrees, I'm going to come towards the end and I'm going
to if I start affecting this, it will create a new keyframe.
So I'm just going to click in here and say -23, hit return.
And that creates a keyframe there.
And as you can see, we've kind of swiveled in the opposite direction.
So now if I take off the specular highlight and just play that through.
Let's hope that, doesn't it?
And it just kind of it gives a bit more gravitas, a bit more stuff to a basic screen recording.
Now, if I add that specular highlight and play that back through, you'll see that as we move this
specular highlight moves across and it kind of gives the impression that we're looking at a monitor
and it's actually in the 3D space.
Final thing that I would do is I would add a drop shadow.
So grab this drop shadow on here.
You see how the drop shadow is kind of bent.
If I toggling off and on, you'll see if you look down in this corner here, toggle on and off, it's
there.
So I'm just going to take the opacity all the way up to 100.
And then going to move it a little bit away to start off with and see how that works.
And then going to blur it out.
Yeah, I'm quite happy with that.
So if we play that back now, we've got the specular highlight.
You see how the shadows down here as well.
So with our specular highlights on here, we've got a drop shadow on here, giving it more of a presence
in whatever space it is.
It's obviously on a white background and if I hit play back through that shadow moves with it.
Specular highlight runs past and as we come back around, you got the shadow on here.
It just makes it much nicer as opposed to just a basic if I go back into the mask because nothing's
been changed within the nest, just if that was playing.
That's just a boring, boring screen recording.
Whereas this.
It just it gives it much more gravitas, much more feel.
So that's your basic 3D in within that premiere pro.
We've done a vertical flip and we've also rotated around to make sure that our horizons are level much
nicer.


### 4. Character Introduction

Now this a fact that we're going to do in this action has a number of names.
A number of people call it like an intro.
You know, a number of people call it like a like a naming slide.
Well, I like to call it is a character introduction.
And this is how it looks.
That kind of style is used on so many things.
He's far too cool.
So many intros, so many YouTube channels, so many just things on TV.
And in this section I'm going to show you how to make that.
So first and foremost, we need to get our footage.
So I'm going to go to Motion Array again and I'm going to search for on the street.
And I found this dancing guy.
I mean, how cozy.
Seriously, I just I just literally want to be as cool as him.
So I'm going to download that and it will very shortly end up in here over in motion.
Right.
Which remember whenever you download in the promotion, Ray brings it straight into your while.
This is really got quite big, hasn't it, into your motion rape scene.
I've got stuff well down here as well.
Let's just close them.
In fact, if I just select them all and twirl them up, maybe that used to work.
Maybe it doesn't anymore.
And what is that called?
Dance on the Street should be here any moment now.
Okay.
That's taken a little bit longer than expected because it's actually a 4K piece of footage, which is
great for us because as you would have seen in the intro, although I in real life I haven't made it
yet, there's some zooming as well, so that's good.
So nothing will be lost.
And why is he dancing on the street?
And let's just drag him into the sequence.
So here is all cool.
Let me get rid of the rules.
And yeah, you know what?
For now, I'm just going to close out these panels just so you can see this a little bit clearer.
So there he is doing his thing.
He's very cool.
Okay.
So we're going to leave this play a little bit.
And I think when he looks up his phone, we're going to pause it.
It's a frame where.
Actually.
Now I'm going to get it where he puts his hands up.
Boom!
Right there.
Now, you see how we've got a bit of motion blur here.
You see how when you freeze frame, you see how his hands are blurred.
And I try and get a bit where he is stopped in time long enough.
So there's no.
That's cool.
I'm going to I'm going to grab that.
Cool.
So how we start this is that we need to create the style of this.
Now we know how to do that.
Either click this or see and export.
Estelle.
But what I'm actually doing here to create the is I'm going to I'm going to create a frame hold section.
What is that?
Well, it it's exactly what it says on the tin.
If I right click and go to frame hold options.
I can create a frame hold within this.
But the easiest and quickest way bang them.
And this is going to affect everything on your timeline.
So it's best to do it kind of somewhere where it's not going to affect any other track.
Any other footage on a track.
Little right click and insert frame hold segment.
See what that's just created there.
That right there is technically an image.
Of this.
So if I play across these clips, he stopped.
And then we carry on again.
Okay, so that's what that's done.
Now I'm going to create just a little bit more room so we can see we can we can kind of decide what
we're doing after the fact.
So that's cool.
Happy with him there?
That looks great.
So what we're going to do is we're going to hold down Alt and we're going to drag up and let go.
So we've created two versions of this guy.
And the reason will become very clear very soon.
So first and foremost, I'm going to highlight this first clip.
And what we need to do is we need to trace out this guy.
Now, this is the first time we've ever used this, and this is the pen tool.
Okay.
So that's now going to be creating a mask around this fellow.
So I'm going to tell you this to make it a little bit clearer.
And if you're not familiar with the pen tool, I'll leave a link in your worksheet as well, which is
a great, great resource to be able to work out how to use the pen tool.
And it's it's web.
It's web based.
And it's it's brilliant.
I'll just show you very quickly.
It's called the Basia Game.
And in short, that's all you do.
You play with the pen tool.
So if you bring your mouse, you can see that.
Okay.
So I click there and I click there and I click there and I've won.
So now it's tell me about Shift.
And that you grab it here.
And that doesn't work because you're dragging.
So if I undo control and that works.
But you can.
Playground here and around here and you kind of get the picture.
If you work through this whole thing.
It really helps you with your pencil ability.
Okay.
So I'm going to say very briefly and very vaguely say what I'm doing, but I'm literally just using
this to create a path around this guy.
You don't have to be absolutely accurate.
Just kind of close to him.
And you'll see what I mean.
When we get closer to the end.
And we're getting towards the end now.
I thought speed that up to save your insanity if you want to know how I spent that.
Up next chapter is going to be speeding up video.
And as you've seen just in here, it's so much easier to be able to give an idea of things just in a
much quicker way.
Yeah, you'd have you'd have probably had time to have a full three course meal in that the pencil isn't
great in Premiere Pro, anything like this that I would normally do, I normally kind of export it into
into Photoshop and do it there, but I want to do everything in here with regards to this.
So that's him drawn all the way out.
So it's till out that's fully masked.
We've been working on this top clip and there you can see the path, the mask that we've done.
It's still there.
I've just selected it.
Now, if I select the button, click and disable it with zero on the number path, remember we set back
keyboard shortcut.
There he is.
He's completely cut out of that sequence.
Good.
So what we then want to do is if we go to our effects and go for paint bucket.
And drag that on.
It doesn't really do anything.
Now, I could I could kind of move along from here, but just very quickly, if I start playing, it
doesn't do it the right way.
Okay?
And that's why we need to nest this first.
So let's undo an undo.
And actually, at this point, I'm just going to take the mask further down to zero just to show you
what that does.
There's our mask there.
If I turn up the mask feather, you can see that all this comes out and sometimes you want back just
to kind of give a little bit of room for error.
We don't want to do that with the mask feather.
We don't want that because we want a full stroke around him.
So now we've got he's selected.
We're going to nest this and we're going to call this cut out Kevin.
I'm calling him Kevin.
And he's an amazing dancer.
He's the greatest dancer.
So with that done, what we're now going to do is we're going to grab the paint bucket and we're going
to drop that onto him again.
Nothing has happened.
But if we go fill selector and opacity, we have this again.
But if we drop this down and go to stroke, boom, you've already got the stroke.
It's there now.
As you saw in the clip, we have this white, so we turn that to white and I'm just going to bring the
stroke width up a little bit.
You see what I mean about how you didn't need to be absolutely bob on with this.
You know it just it's just an effect that we're going for.
It's still a little bit thick around there.
So actually I'm going to bring that down just a little bit.
That's probably enough.
That's all we need at that point.
So how do we then create all the other stuff?
Well, you saw there was a slight grow of him.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to scale him up.
But as you see, as I scale him up, he kind of he's here around the back as well.
And I don't want that.
So what I'm going to do and this takes a little bit of trial and error, I'm going to grab the anchor
point for this clip and you see what that is.
I'm going to drag it just on the centre of his chest.
So he kind of scales up from the centre of himself.
If I drank that up, you see, how about it?
And he's less kind of in here, you see his arms, but we'll play around with that.
So let's bring them back down again.
Just cancel that.
I'm going to set a keyframe.
We can move this around, set a keyframe for the scale and the position.
Move it along a bit and we're going to scale him up.
A little bit.
You see how his foot is there.
So maybe we'll go over a little bit.
And you know what?
We can hide this with?
We can hide this actually, if we just turn up the stroke a little bit.
Uh, a little bit more.
Maybe not too much.
I move him around a little bit over to the left a bit.
Doesn't really matter too much, because you'll see what we do with the at the bottom clip, the background
layer.
So there he is.
There's Kevin.
There it down a little bit more as keep his hands in.
I mean, you could do this forever, really.
But theirs his fate.
But that's absolutely fine.
So what we're gonna do with this now?
Well, we've got that coming up.
Let's just bring that back and just show him.
Play that back.
And he's grown up a little bit.
Cool.
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring those keyframes to the beginning.
And I'm going to.
I want that to go even slower.
So let's bring that up to about maybe there and let's grow that out.
Good.
Like that.
Happy?
I think I'll be happy with that being the end of the the whole thing, and then we'll go back to him.
So to do that, I'm going to highlight them both and I just want to trim the end.
So with them both highlighted W And then we're back into him dancing.
Cool.
So now we've got that moving up here on this top clip.
We're then going to keyframe some other things on the bottom clip.
First and foremost, we're going to take down the exposure just to kind of bring him more front and
center.
We're also going to bring down the the saturation.
How do we do that?
Well, if we go to color and let's keep effect controls on I'm just going to effect something quickly
because then that brings up the metering color in here, just going to undo that.
But it stays.
And the reason why I want it here is because I want to keyframe it.
Okay.
So if I find exposure that right to the beginning of the clip, I'm going to talk a lot of keyframe
and then going to come along a little bit.
And I'm going to bring down that exposure just to about.
They're good.
Happy with that.
At the same time, I'm also going to bring down the saturation.
So you know how saturation is down here, where it's over here as well.
So I'm going to hit the keyframe for saturation.
I'm going to go back to the beginning of the keyframe for the exposure.
Seth Keyframe there on saturation, come across and just bring down that saturation just a little bit.
You see how it now really pops because I've brought down the saturation there.
The final one I'm going to do is I'm actually going to bring on I'm going to blur out the background
a little bit.
So if I go back to here, just so I can easily get to my effects and we're going to add what's called
a gauzy and blur, causing blur, it's used on so much.
And if I drag that onto this bottom clip, nothing happens yet because it's set to zero.
But here's Gaussian blur.
I'm just going to make a keyframe there at the end right there.
Begin again, put another keyframe and then go back to the next, the second keyframe, where everything
is kind of, you know, desaturated and darker.
And I'm going to drag this up a little bit and watch the back, see how that's blurred out, blur out
a little bit more.
And there he is.
So if we kind of play that back from here, you can see that now we have Kevin being brought out, boom.
And then we go back to him dancing.
So all that's left really is to put that text that you saw behind.
How do we do that?
Well, I will use what I love using reset the layout because I want to bring up my premiere composer
and let's find some text for him.
Going to go into essential typography text maybe two lines and.
Do you know what to do?
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to go to the starter pack and I'm going to go for Tex Presets.
You see how we have all these?
I want one where it's going to be moving in.
That one.
Love that.
So I'm going to click this and I'm going to say I want it to come in from yeah, I want to come in from
the left and let's I'm that cool so if I place that over our clip.
And what I want to do is I want to have it positioned over to the side here.
So I'm going to move this position over here and we're going to say we're going to put this off, as
Kevin did.
Leave it.
Wait, because that's the core of this stroke.
I'm going to add a chain this to my Norwest because I love that.
And let's see how that looks.
Kevin.
Good.
Now, as you saw, that actually started on the side there.
Hmm.
That's part of the animation.
So I want that to start off screen.
No further.
I'm going to add motion blur here.
So with Motion Blur, we'll play it through.
And it comes in, let's just pre render this quickly just so we can see it properly set out in and out
point control and to pre render.
And we'll play that back.
That's Kevin.
And then Malkoff.
Good.
Happy with that?
Now I'm going to create a second line first, and then I'm going to show you the last little bit.
So I'm going to duplicate this.
So we've got Kevin twice.
I'm going to use the bottom one just to just good for my eyes.
I'm going to bring that one down.
So we've got two versions of Kevin and we're going to go right dancing, man.
He's a dancing man.
I'm going to change this to maybe next to going to bring it down the scale down a little bit.
And we're going to bring it up and we're going to make it less justified.
So we're going to line up the D with a K, in fact.
So don't go too far.
So I'm going to select the first one.
Kevin and I going to bring that over.
Oh, that would differ just to that.
Okay.
And I want I want the text coming in behind him.
Well, the great thing is, is that we've got Kevin cut out.
Fine.
Go back a couple of frames.
So we've got him.
We have the motion blur on.
So that's just turn the motion blur off for now.
So you can see what I mean.
You see how the V is over him.
It's kind of in front of him.
Let's go back a couple of frames.
So it kind of fully really shows.
Oh, yeah.
So there's the eye right in front of him.
So because we've got him cut out, we can have the text going behind him.
And the easy way to do that is this bit right here, which has him cut out.
We just put it above the text.
You see how the eye isn't there now.
If I turn off that, you can see the eye is there.
So both of those are now gone behind him.
Just going to go back in and turn on the motion blur again and pre render this.
In fact, let's pretend at all.
And now if you play this back from the beginning, we've got Kevin having a really good dance and people
think, Oh, who's that guy?
Well, he's Kevin the dancing man.
And he goes up.
It's a cool effect, isn't it?


### 5. Speed Up Footage

So to show you the speeding up of a clip, I'm going to kind of take you a little bit behind the scenes,
because this is our main my main project for editing all the bits for the course.
If you're if you, if you like me and you love the film Inception, this is about two levels down.
So this is the bit where we where we sped up.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to grab that bit and I'm just going to duplicate these over
here.
I'm going to take them back to how they were.
I know I spent that up as well as at night.
So this is the clip that we want to speed up.
First and foremost, I've got the beginning and the end here on this clip.
And then I've got up here.
I've got this better clip, which is where I come back in talking and that was this and now say what
I did.
So what we've done here is what I first want to do is I want to clear or kill the audio, but I'm not
going to because I'm going to show you how that sound if we leave the audio in.
So first and foremost, right click and the the kind of hard away would be speed, duration.
Now, anything that's normal speed is 100%.
So we want to speed it up.
So we want it more than 100%.
So if we go in here and type 200%, we half it because we speed it up to twice.
Now, that's not going to be quick enough.
Let's say it starts at 24 minutes.
It still finishes at 27 minutes.
You going to be looking at, well, 3 minutes effectively of all that.
So what I want to do is I want to get it through in about 10 seconds.
As you can see here, we're starting this on 24 minutes and 12 seconds.
So let's say I want to be out by 24 one.
That's about 9 seconds.
So the easy way to do this is to use the rate stretch tool.
It's easy to say it's it's actually R on a keyboard.
It's actually up here as well.
So if I hit V again, you can either click there for the right stretch tool or just hit on your keyboard.
That's a default.
And all I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this all the way back here.
Now, you and I both know if I'd have done that without the right stretch tool, it would have shorten
the clip.
But because we used in the rate stretch tool going to be on my keyboard to get back in and if I play
this now.
First and foremost, we can either grab this and drag it all the way down, which is the volume on this
track.
Or what I like to do is I like to alt and click and then just press zero to disable the audio track.
But because it did alt, it only selected the audio and closed this up with the next bit.
And so that comes out and then it starts normal time.
This is by right click and click speed duration 100%.
By the way, if I was doing that manually for this one, I'd have had to type in a 4042 and 60.67%.
You have a lot easier just to drag it back with the right stretch tool.
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do what's called a J cuts just to make this a little bit
cleaner.
A little bit, I don't know, just to flow a little bit better because although it may not seem a lot,
having 9 seconds with nothing being said is a lot.
So I was only be happy with it being around here.
I wanted to be speaking, so this is how I did it.
So let's get to listen to the audio.
And it's now.
I want to go there.
So here's the audio that's going to come back in.
And it's it's in our thoughts to say, if you want to know, I'm going to go just before there, because
then that brings it into context as to where we're finishing up.
So remember the alt key.
The alt and click will singularly select a linked clip.
What I want to do with this is I want to hold down Alt and I want to drag back the video.
You see how it doesn't affect the audio?
The reason why I have done that is because I want to come back in on this video with this audio at this
point.
But this audio underneath here, I want it to go underneath, literally underneath the sped up bit.
So then I just click it back there playthrough.
And then there was this.
And it's now.
Thoughts on cigarettes.
If you want to know how I watch this next chapter, you see how that works just really quite nicely
to speed it up.
You've got a few moments with nothing being said and then the audio brings you back in real time.
It's such an easy thing to do.
Speed up and slow down.
If you want it to slow down, we will touch on that in another section.
Think we might?
Oh, we might need some more footage.
Some new footage, maybe, but we shall see.
But yeah, that's how to simply speed up a clip.
And the easiest, easiest way, just by literally reach to rate stretch to try and say that ten times
quickly and then just pulling it back to where you want it to be.
Perfect.


### 6. Animate a Progress Bar

Okay.
So for this one, we're going to look at an old editor of mine for a video I've done on my own channel.
It's for a product called the P2.
It's the painter, which actually you make.
Where's my bro?
You make beer out of this?
It's brilliant.
Please drink responsibly.
But it's all about the cleaning.
And what I'm made here is the amount of times where people go on.
On YouTube and they don't know how long the intro is.
And they think, Oh, do I need to skip and all that?
So this is a small, tiny little progress bar to show how long the show is going to be.
And it looks like this third video on the P2.
I'm probably one of the most important.
So the speed in which that went along reassured the viewer that by the time he gets all the way to the
end, don't worry, we're going to be finished and we're going to be into the video.
Let me show you how to make it.
So this is a recent project that I did for a review on my channel, my own channel, and it's for a
it's for the painter, which is a beer brewing thing.
And I absolutely love it.
So I've done loads of reviews on it and it's been really, really successful.
However, what I want to show you is that's that's me.
You see that camera just over my shoulder right in the beginning of this section?
That's the camera I was recording, looking that way.
So you can now see what I can see while I'm recording these this course.
And what I want to show you is what I've just shown you is a really simple way to do it.
And we're going to use a colour mat.
So first and foremost, let's we could track this climate.
Actually, this is one that I've got in here, which is the blue green, which is underneath there.
That's one of my brand colours.
So I'm going to I'm going to grab that and I'm going to bring it down here.
Now, obviously you could have just easily right clicked and new item colour mats pressed okay and selected
your colour.
I could select that colour again and make another one and it would go in here.
But yeah, I've just done it twice now.
So this is the column that I want to use to make this progress bar perfect.
However, I'm covering absolutely everything, so there's a number of ways we can get this to size down.
But the way I want to do it is with Chrome because I want to do something else as well.
So let's pull this to maybe the end of the Dissolve because that's when it's going to be in view.
And I'm going to bring it right the way back to the beginning of this clip.
And we're going to show that this is the intro.
You've already seen this when I showed you exactly what we're going to be doing.
And so I go up to my effects just here.
And by the way, if you've lost this, it's not that you just go to windows and go to effects window,
even an effects.
And we type in crop and we drag that crop as we've done before onto the color mat, which then places
the crop up here.
So the first thing we want to do is want to bring it down from the top so we can see where we're at.
And by doing dragging all the way up there, that's where I want to be.
So I'm already at 98%.
If I tilted this on, you can see it actually still takes up quite a bit the screen so it can easily
be seen.
So that's where we want our progress bar to be up to and then we bring the right up, which will bring
the right this way.
So that's simple as that.
Yeah.
Are you with me?
Good.
I'm not going to bring it all the way, though, because I want to animate this in first and you want
to kind of be able to see it.
So let's do that first, shall we?
Yeah, let's do that first.
So let's bring it right the way to the back.
And as you can see, all you can see is that little cropped color map.
We're going to set a position keyframe and then I'm going to hold down shift and go forward 15 frames.
So with shift held and I'm on here with my right arrow on my keyboard, five, ten, 15, and I'm going
to set another keyframe there.
Okay, good.
Go back to the first keyframe and I'm just going to drag the position down so it's off the screen.
And then I'm going to right click and ease out and right click and ease in.
So we now have this third video on the page, so it comes up nice and slowly.
I'm going to drag out just a little, little bit longer, actually.
Let's just see the third video on the page.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
And then at that point, I want it to start animating across because I want to kind of show this is
something that is there rather than just starting all the way up.
So what else do we do?
Well, from this point on, when it comes in, I'm going to animate my right crop and then I drag a
little bit along and I'm going to press reset, which will take it to zero, which means it'll be all
the way along.
And then going to drag this I'm not going to drag this all the way to the end of the clip.
Or am I?
Yes, I am, because the clip isn't there.
It's underneath the Dissolve So then I drag this all the way to the end of the clip and I'm going to
ease out the first clip.
Does the first keyframe doesn't matter with the second keyframe because it will be out by then.
So let's take this back and see how that looks.
Third video on the PS2.
I'm probably one of the most important.
I see that.
It's nice, isn't it?
I'm actually going to play with this a little bit.
I'm going to.
Have a little bit of a nice curve coming in.
So to do that, I'm going to highlight both of these.
I'm going to drag this handle.
This way.
That will then make a curve.
So it kind of comes faster and then slows down rather than just slow and slow.
And if I take this back, we can see how that will affect third video on the PS2.
I'm probably one of the most important.
Now we can add to this and you'll have seen when I first showed you I did add to this and I added a
little bit of text that said intro.
And to do that, I'm just going to in fact, I'm going to do this manually just to show you how to do
it manually.
But it will probably make the case for the fact that, yeah, it's a lot easier just to get the premiere
composer down for free and do it yourself.
But I'm going to go to the title.
I'm just going to click here and type intro.
So I'm now going to highlight the text dropdown and go to my.
It's no, it's not.
No ESTA.
Montserrat is my main my main font and I'm going to go Montserrat and Medium and I'm going to just slowly
bring it down and bring it back.
Now, what I want to do is I want that to come up behind the actual animation.
But let's animate this first so we know where we're at.
I'm going to bring it the whole way.
I'm going to move this up because I want this underneath that fade outs as well for my titles.
And then I'm going to go back on here to the Keyframe where that has just come in.
Okay.
So that's when this column at the start of the Progress Bar has just come in.
I'm going to set the keyframe for my position on my my text, and I'm going to stay out there and stay
in there.
I'm going to hold down shift and go five, ten notes to do ten.
So that's ten frames and click into the keyframe.
Go back to the first keyframe and I'm just going to drag it down and out.
Good.
Happy with that so far?
Great.
Now, if I just left that, it would go like this third video on the P2.
And that doesn't really work for me for two reasons.
One, I want these to go the other way around.
So I'm going to grab this column out.
And just up here right now, I'm going to move the text down and then I put the column at above it.
So it will come up third video on the page to find it good like that.
Third video on the P2 doesn't quite hit for me though.
That's its positives.
So he's out on the second being, he's in.
Let's see how that feels.
Third video on the P2, I want a little bit earlier I actually that my third video on the P2.
Yeah.
So let's go back here and let's find where these key frames are.
And I want to make the first keyframes start in the middle.
Of the animation up of the actual progress third video on the P two I'm probably do you know what I'm
probably going to start the growing third video on the pizza and start the growing a little bit earlier.
So let's go let's split in the middle of those again.
Let's bring the animation back.
So it kind of starts animating across as soon as it comes up.
Third video on the pizza and probably one of the most important things.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
Couple of things I also want to do with the text.
So I've selected the text and go to in my essentials graphics panel hit intro, which is the text and
I'm going to add a bit of a shadow.
I love a shadow.
I just love a drop shadow.
Don't, don't hate me.
I'm going to take it all the way up to 100%.
I'm going to blur it out a little bit.
Move it off a little bit.
I'm looking down here, by the way, of a little bit, maybe on blur it just a little bit so I can see
it better.
Good.
Happy with that.
Happy, happy, good.
Go back and have a look at that.
Third video on the PS2.
I'm probably one of the most important.
So far.
I've by the way, if you're wondering these all these titles, these are all made in after effects with
premiere pro premiere composer in After Effects.
We?
So far I called.
However, just to recap that, all we've done is we've created a column at cropped it all the way down,
cropped it all the way in from the right almost, and then just animated it out.
Let me know your thoughts, said video on the page.
Do we think it needs to come up or do we think it just needs to start growing in from the outside?
I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong and I think I am wrong.
I'm going to turn off the key framing of the position because that's fine.
And I'm actually going to set this key frame, which is still on the column at two 100%.
I'm going to track it right back to the beginning.
So then it looks like this third video on the P to a part looks better, doesn't it?
However, intro now I think needs to come in from the side as well.
But the beauty is, is because we've done these ourselves, we can easily, easily edit them.
The easiest way to do this is I'm going to go to the second keyframe, which is where I want it going
to select the first keyframe, and I'm going to delete it.
So that means when I come back here, it's not there.
And then all I'm going to do is I'm going to drag this off, which, as we all know, creates a new
keyframe.
I'm going to make sure that that is easing out.
Make sure that that is easing in.
And if we go right back.
Third video on the P2.
I'm.
Third video on the PS2.
I'm probably one of the most important.
Good.
Make it happy with that.
Good.


### 7. Masking Transition

I am so glad that you don't see any of the behind the scenes with regards to this at times.
And that's because I've been racking my brains trying to find the sequences for two times where I've
used this transition professionally and I don't have one of them, but I have to render.
But I do have the other one.
So this is my.
Well, yeah, this is up there.
My top five, maybe even top three transitions.
Let me just turn this down.
Let me show you what this transition is.
And what I want to say here is this transition is it works a little bit like a stage manager, a good
stage manager in a theater.
If a good stage manager is doing their job correctly, you don't notice them because everything runs
as expected and you never, ever see them.
You don't know the existence of them.
I used to work in an entertainment and yeah, it was the biggest bugbear of all stage managers.
The fact that if they did the job right, you didn't know they existed.
It's kind of the same with this transition.
This transition also has been used in a lot of a lot of TV and Hollywood.
If you're familiar with the Sherlock series, it's used a lot in that as well.
And when it's done correctly with the right footage, it's it's just it's breathtaking.
And the viewer doesn't notice it at first and thinks, oh, what happened there?
And it's usually used to drive the story and the example, the footage I'm going to be using.
It doesn't really drive the story, but it kind of really highlights it.
But the two ways that I've used it in this professional work, it does drive the story.
So this is the first one that I selected.
I've just turned on the audio a little bit.
Let me just check if it's quiet enough.
Yeah, that's okay.
So this is a company called Fortune Sons, their facilities management, what they do or this guy does,
Mac, is he provides a service where he installs handrails for those who have disabilities or infirm.
And the brief was to kind of show a day in the life.
So we did a kind of a Postman Pat feel in as much as we just saw him rock up in his van, he's gone
to the place that makes these you see these transitions.
There's the zoom out and the left transition from primary pro.
And yeah, we did the kind of postman pat thing where we followed him along and it's in this location
where this transition takes place.
So this is the powder coating going on.
And once this powder coating is on the steel rail and then goes into here, which is a big oven, and
let me let's see if you notice the transition first.
So there is he's putting on the powder coating and then we're into the oven.
Did you notice it?
Did you see the transition?
And obviously a lot of these clips are just cut.
I mean, that's a zoom transition.
But then we cut and just simple cut cuts and a cut can be used very effectively.
And cuts is still the number one transition.
It's just easy.
It doesn't overcomplicate things.
But I wanted to drive the narrative here and I wanted to kind of speed it up, but not in a kind of,
Oh, I've missed something.
So here we've got human powder coating.
And then what I do is I've taken the opposite corner to this.
If we go back out, we saw that it's a square.
It's a square thing.
And so hold everything and it's on casters, it's on wheels.
So what I did is when I was filming this all on a gimbal, I took this corner here, not in this shot,
but in the next shot.
I filmed close enough to make sure that the opposite corner to this, which is this corner film, filled
the whole frame.
And this is the big thing about this transition.
You need something that fills the whole frame and that goes across it either horizontally or vertically.
And the way it works, if we watch here, this doesn't make sense.
That's not what should be the other side of this pole.
It should be the continuation of this frame.
But as we step through, it reveals the same frame on wheels.
But moving, but we get going.
I mean, it kind of tricks the eyes a little bit trippy, but when it's done right.
It drives it.
And it's it's it's also sometimes known as the seamless transition.
I like I like to call it the masculine transition because it's kind of what it does.
You mask out.
Let me show you another example of this, and that's in Scott Comanche Hippy Mundi.
You saw Forest Funk a while back and just check the audio IP.
Yeah.
So you saw Forest Funk.
Remember where he was?
He was just as he was up on the on the on the horses as a Comanche Indian.
Well, this is a remember, this guy's got a Comanche heritage and he's really knuckling down on it
because he's so proud of it.
And this is a song about a lady called Hippie Bundy.
And she, by the way, that overlay right there, that was from Motion.
Right as well.
Just track that.
We'll talk about that later in a further in a future section it's it'll be under video or overlays anyway
so this was the story where we we we brought this this lady called hippie mundi and she was just a happy,
happy person.
Oh, by the way, you see the box coming in, done that before.
And she absolutely loved life.
But she she suffered a lot from from mental health.
And sadly, her life took a downward toll.
She was a very good friend of Scott's, and he wanted to write a song about her.
If you're if you're interested, you'd like to see this search for Happy Man, the Scott Comanche.
It's actually one arm and it's i.e isn't it funny how the renders are never really what you've set up
when you've set up a sequence, but it's hitting him on the head or pai mundi and he's got Comanche
with one arm because that's how it's supposed to be spelled.
But yeah, we, so we tell this story and the, where I use the transition is where she and she starts
the downward spiral of her life and it's just coming up right here.
She so we've laid this drug deal because this is what she does.
She turns to narcotics.
And Ted, life really does take a real downward spiral.
So we have this clip here where we establish and this is the car coming in and Mandy's right there,
problems of self-control.
And then she does the drug deal and then he drives away and then we're in the house.
Did you see the transition?
By slowly go down.
This, by the way, we will be touching on this.
If you've got a mouse with a scroll wheel and rather than down here where up and down gets you up and
down the timeline, this brings you one click frame by frame through a video.
It's brilliant.
It's something I've only actually worked out in recent months and it really helps helps you scrub finally.
But if you look here as we come through, the car goes past and then we're in a house.
Well, thankfully, this isn't the render.
This is actually the actual sequence.
So I can I've copied those out and I've put them in here.
I can see exactly what's happening.
Let me just play that back through.
So you've got that part and then he drives off.
He was actually a lovely bloke and we're now in with the duck.
Well, if we go back to this clip, if we look over the effects controls, something's happening here
and it's to do with a mask in opacity.
Disclose that a little bit in more detail.
But first and foremost, let's just have a look what's happening with this mask.
If I highlight the mask, we can now see the mask.
If I go to 50%, that's not enough.
25%.
Yeah.
So as you can see, there's our mask.
And if I scroll down on the on the mouse wheel, you can see that the play head is getting close to
these key frames.
And if I get to the first keyframe, you can see that the car is fully covering the frame.
However, as I step down with my mouse and click down.
This mask is now traveling along and it's cutting out the car.
And below it.
Is this clip.
If I disable this clip for now, you can see that.
It's cutting out that video.
So all the way along that car, the edge of the car works as a wipe.
If I bring this back in.
Let me just highlight the mask again.
You can see it all working.
It doesn't have to be pretty mask.
I mean, look at this point.
I think I just.
Yeah, that'll be fine.
I'll get rid of that point on the next or I'll move it out and all around it.
Yeah.
It doesn't have to be pretty.
It just has to mask.
It just has to mark the part that we tried to get rid of.
Fancy learning how to do this.
Right.
Let's go.
So I've taken the liberty of going to motion away and grabbing a couple of clips down.
First and foremost, we have a a New York City subway platform.
Let me just go to fit so we can see it properly.
And what I wanted to do is rather.
Robin, tell the story.
In this case, I'll say I've only got one clip I wanted to really highlight or maybe kind of give a
feeling of where someone would rather be.
Robin on the subway.
This isn't a slight on the New York City subway.
I think they're all the same as as delightful as ever.
So we're going from the subway to.
A lovely field of wheat.
Good.
You follow me on this?
Okay.
So what do we do first?
Well, and this is the clip that we want to make out of.
So we're going to put this on the second video track.
This is going to come under here, but not for now.
We don't need to do that just yet.
So what am I looking for and why have I selected this piece of footage to use for this section?
Well, you can kind of see right here.
That's the back of someone.
And that.
That someone has walked right across.
There's another guy there, but his walked right across the scene.
I'm pretty sure.
Whoever's created this.
As though.
Yeah, that's exactly what it would be useful.
Okay.
So how do we do this?
Well, first and foremost, we have this first person walking past and we could use that guy.
But I'm going to use this one because it's almost like a fake, you know, in like sport, you see,
so past.
Oh, you can see.
Oh, no, maybe you you're watching this and you think you expected that to happen because this is such
a well used effect.
I think I don't think it's overused.
And I think that's because of the amount of work that goes into achieving this effect.
It's not it's it's it's it is easy once you get your head around it.
But it is also can be quite time consuming depending on what you're masking up.
So let's get this guy and that's the guy that we're going to use to mask across.
Okay.
So let's get to the point where he he comes in, but we don't want his front.
We're not masking from his front.
We're masking from his back.
We must from his front.
All of a sudden, this would just wipe across and we wouldn't know there was a person there wiping across.
So that makes sense.
Good.
So let's use them.
I'm just on here now.
I'm just going right and left on my keyboard, on the cursor to decide where to stop the mask.
And I'm looking right up here because when it's people, if I get him a little bit further on, as you
can see, if we're looking to draw a a vertical line down, the earliest point in which this happens
is right here, the nape of his neck, because that's the further most left, the further goes forward
that we're going to need to mask out.
So if we go back, we need to get from where he comes in.
However, he's also got some up and down movement which we're going to have to bear in mind and will
probably make it a little bit more difficult or a little bit more time consuming to mask it.
You can be as accurate or as inaccurate as you want to be with this.
So I'm going to show you the basics, and I'm not going to finesse it too much, but I'll give you the
tools to be able to finesse it.
You won't be sitting here for hours while I while I do this.
So how do we do this?
Well, first and foremost, we need to engage this clip.
And we what we want to do is we want to start off a masking transition.
So I need to click the pencil.
The minute I click the pen tool, you'll see this kind of had a little bit of a moment.
It's back to where it was.
And we've now opened a mask.
We've started a mask, although we've not done anything.
We now have all the dialog for the mask.
And I cannot stress this enough.
Now listen to me.
The most important thing you need to do is toggle on the key framing, because if you don't toggle on
this key framing here with mask path, you start drawing your path, you move along, which is what
we'll do.
We'll move the mask along and all that.
If you get to here and you're like, Yeah, okay, great.
And then you look back and you realize that you hadn't toggled this on.
None of the information that you will have fed, it will have been recorded and you'll have masked it
and then moved on.
And you get to the end and you play it back and the mask will just be here.
It will literally just be here, and you'll have a moment.
You may have a little bit of a breakdown, and then you'll realize you have to do all that work all
over again.
And normally at that point you think, Oh, forget it, I'm not going to do that transition up.
I'll just put a pan transition in or something and it leaves.
So the most important thing is to toggle this on, but I'm not going to toggle on here.
I'm going to go back scrolling up on the mouse wheel.
By the way, if you don't have a mouse, even on a laptop, if you don't have a mouse and you're if
I haven't made this point clear enough yet, you need a mouse.
I can't stress this enough.
The amount of people that I see that edit and they only have a touchpad on the keyboard and okay, yeah,
that's great for being mobile, but the sizes of mice you can get now, even a tiny, small one just
I'll just just get one because it helps you out so much with your workflow.
Just take that as a top tip.
Anyway, so I'm scrolling up while my mouse, while my cursor is in the window and I can go back frame
by frame.
And this is where I want to start my mask.
We're going to hit Keyframe, but not yet, not yet.
Don't do it yet.
You keyframe it.
You toggle on the keyframe once you've drawn your initial mask.
I was going to say your first mask is going to be the same mask all the way through.
This is just the initial mask from which we're going to animate.
Now, the thing is, the reason why I am also saying use your mouse up and down is because the using
the pen tool for.
Anything in Premiere Pro, it's a little bit clunky.
It does apply the same rules as the likes of Photoshop and Illustrator, but it's nowhere near as intuitive.
It's really quite frustrating and you see how we're in fits here.
The minute I move my mouse out here, my mouse, the cursor changes and that's a bit annoying because
what we're going to be doing this and what you do in most masks, unless you're masking a tiny little
bit, is you need to come outside the frame.
So to do that, you need to size this down to probably about 50%.
It's never it's never really that much.
See how it's changing.
So you kind of need to get down to 25% to be able to come out of here while you're drawing a mask.
And that's never great.
So what you'll have to do is you need to.
Tilde So mouse inside this window hit.
Tilde Remember that.
And then if you size it down to maybe 75%, it gives us some room to move.
And that's why being able to scroll up and down on your mouse is absolutely crucial.
So we have our pen selected and we're going to draw our initial mask and you see how I can move around
here and there's no changing of my pen.
That's kind of what we want.
So let me draw my initial mask, which is just simple box.
So that's a mass with four points.
When you get to the initial point that you created, you'll get a little circle there that's just confirming
that you're going to close up that mask and that's not going to be a mask.
So what's now being created?
Well, as you can see, we have four handles or four points that we created.
And we have a center point here.
Nothing really of note to to delineate that.
It's no real different to any of the points around here, but that's just what has been created.
So what do we do from here?
Well, first and foremost, we tilt her out and we literally hit the stopwatch on mask path.
Boom.
Done crackin.
Everything we do from this point will be saved as we go through and through our key frames.
I will stop in another second just to confirm something that we've done in the past.
But first and foremost, where's my mask?
Because I know that I'm at 50%, but I still should should be able to see a bit mask.
That's because the minute that you talk about on for some reason it just it hides it.
So you just need to select your mask again.
And this is what we're working on.
And now we've got our mask back, Tilde back here.
And what I want to do is I actually want to create another point here and another point here.
And that's because if I scroll down, I know that this guy is going to come in here with his head.
So if I leave this here, I can bring this point down to here and kind of finesse it with this point.
It will all become clear, I promise.
But if I tilde out now, I've gone down one frame.
But if I tilt in here, no keyframe has been changed, so no keyframe has been created.
Now you know that if we hit this, we can create a keyframe, and that's fine, and then we can effect
and change the value within this mask.
However, remember when we were keyframe before?
The minute you change your value on something that is has the key framing toggled on and it's a space
that doesn't currently have a keyframe.
If you change the value, move this a little.
If I tilde out now until the back in here that keyframe if I zoom in.
Has been created.
We now have two key frames, one on the back frame, one on that frame.
And that's what we just double checking because what the in here, we're not going to be coming out
of here until the mask is created fully and animated all the way along.
Okay.
To also double check that that has actually worked.
If we go up one on our mouse wheel.
Yep, that's where it was and that's where it is now.
Okay.
Happy with that?
Is that clear?
Okay, let's get into the nuts and bolts.
I just got to 75%.
I still have room to work, so.
Yeah, okay, I'm cracking.
So this is the fun bit and this can be as accurate or as inaccurate as you want, as I've said.
So I will do it.
And I get this point and you can see by now I created this bit because I want to get into the bottom
of this.
Howdy there.
See how this handle has been created?
This is a curve handle.
If I grab this and just drag it, you see how this bit comes down and that bit goes up as because it's
staying true to itself is actually one of these handles over here.
But you can't see it because it's all the way all the way along this line.
So what happens if I don't want to go all the way up here?
Well, this is pen, pencil, one or what?
And if you went to the busy game that I showed you in a previous section, you'll know that if I hold
out and grab this, first and foremost, we get a different little symbol for the mouse cursor and it's
just a little V upside down.
And we're only now affecting this handle.
Whereas if we didn't have alt held we'd be affecting make a layer of me would be if I selected it on
its own me if I select this back again that is.
Those are the handle now.
And if I don't hold alt.
That's never happened in my life, but that really helps.
So if I selected it with an alt.
So if I grab it now down.
Great.
However, however works for you in the moment that you're in ult will help you just affect one direction
of the curve.
Okay, good.
I'm also this is another little trick if you've got a points here that's been created and it doesn't
have any handles.
If you hold down alt and click click the point, it creates curves and then you can have fun with it.
Okay, so now you've got a little curve up here and a lung curve up here.
So I'm just going to grab this point and just bring it down.
And this whole process is just making you familiarize yourself with the pen tool now that's been created.
Just Tilde out there.
I promise I won't do this every time.
But now we've got two keyframes and that first keyframe is all of that and that.
So that second keyframe is all over and that first keyframe that if we click back, is that okay?
So between that key, those two keyframes, we're going from that to that.
Okay.
And we know that the keyframes are being created, so the information is being saved.
I can't stress this enough.
You don't want to get to the end and realized you hadn't toggled on key framing.
So let's go down one more frame.
And there he is.
He's moving along.
So, okay, let's follow him.
So we're going along here with this.
Maybe I went a little bit too far with that.
Maybe come down so I can make it a little bit more accurate.
Good.
And we've just got the rounding of his shoulder there and come down here.
Now, I'm going to keep an eye down here because I can see black there.
Now, I don't know if that obviously the top and bottom here is black.
So it kind of helps us to eyeball that.
But I don't know if that shadow or his back, I don't think it's his back.
So that keyframe has now been created.
I did say, I promise I won't do that every time.
But look, we now got three keyframes.
Good.
The last hour confirmed, I promise.
So down once with the click and okay.
That black here is just shadow.
So we follow along with him here.
However, he hasn't really moved that much up or down and the that shape looks the same shape.
And because he's walking directly across and not moving up towards or away from the camera, we can
probably just move this whole mask over.
And to do that, as you can see, when I'm outside, we're playing with notes and all that kind of stuff.
But when I'm inside, I have a hand tool.
Now this just automatically goes to hand when we're inside a mask.
It's it's one thing within masking that I like in Premiere Pro and if we just click and drag.
We can move the whole mosque.
That's cool.
You see how I'm asking everything now?
And you can kind of see how we're going to work this alone.
As he moves, we're going to come along with him.
But first and foremost, let's get to this one.
And if we just move the mosque just a little bit there.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
I will scroll down with the mouse wheel.
Can we cheat and follow him again?
It looks like it.
Yeah.
And keep an eye in here because we don't know when we're going to run out of this.
Because if you had a really long back with that skull down.
Okay.
We're starting to change shape a little, I think.
Yeah, we are.
So let's get that married up.
But we don't cut off his back because that will make it look really unnatural.
Because, of course, someone walking past you and you're going into a field of wheat from a subway
in New York is natural.
But yeah.
Yeah, I digress.
So okay.
That looks about right, but I'm going to see how this doesn't really feel.
We've got that round there.
But this isn't going to work.
We could.
We could just go down here and drag it up.
But I want to be a little bit more accurate.
So I'm going to go here and I'm now going to come down here.
And if I put my mouse over the cursor over the line, it gives them the option to plus.
And that's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to add another point.
And if I now drag this out, I'm dragging out from here rather than from here.
Okay?
So I can kind of just see the tip of his back there.
So I'm going to drag this in there and I can see his shirt coming in here.
As I said, you can be as accurate or inaccurate as you want.
But I'm going to put another point here.
I'm going to put another point here, putting the point here.
So that's a real problem with the masking tool in Premiere Pro, if you click Too Close to the point,
just puts a rotation on for some reason.
So just undo that and it's fine.
I'm just going to maybe try and get down here.
Corpus happy these three points here these remind me of remember when we were in color and we were looking
at the curves and we were putting a points here or points here at a point here.
The reason why I'm doing that in this point is because the same reason that I'm doing this.
If I didn't have that point in that point, if I only had that point I was putting down, everything
would be coming down.
So I'm affecting this right now.
But because I had points out the side, it was only the red that I was affecting.
Okay, it's the same premise and you just do all that.
It's the same premise in this mask because I've put a point and then we get that mask back.
If you ever do selects, you just come back and just select your mask again.
Because I've put a point here, a point here and a point here.
You can just about see the squares.
That means I can bring in this.
On the other hand, the other points, they work as handles and they hold it out.
Okay.
Be clear on that.
Good.
This is getting a little bit annoying.
I do wish they'd work on this for Premiere Pro.
Okay.
That's just going to have to do right now.
And let's his back looks a little bit angular there, doesn't it?
Let's just say holding down alt is probably actually about there.
Is that.
Okay, good.
And we're now going to go down with the scroll wheel.
We're also going to be able to feather this mask.
And I explained that when we get there.
Okay.
Let's move up with him.
And starting to run into a few problems, at least up here.
Okay.
I'm going to address this first.
I'm actually going to go to 150%.
I'm going to come up here and come up here just so got a little bit more room to work with.
I wish you could hold out alt and zoom in like you do on Photoshop.
You can't.
So again, we work with what we've got and I'm going to curve that down a little bit and bring that
down.
Not that happy with that.
Oh, it's called down and used the mouse wheel, which I've been telling you to do, and it didn't do
what I wanted to do.
Okay, so we're now moving along here.
They I'll get away from the mic.
I'm getting really close to my ear, to my monitor.
Sorry about that.
So we're just going to move this down here a little bit down here.
We could go in there as well.
But I mean, you know, it's it's kind of.
Yeah, I kind of do need to get to another point here.
I'm going to grab this handle and bring that into there.
But then alt.
Grab this handle and bring it out of here.
So.
Good.
Happy.
Okay.
It's got to fit.
And let's move away a lot.
Now I'm cheating a little bit here because this fold was put in his shirt a while back.
If I go up.
Where his father actually was.
However controls that I move down if I come down to here fold isn't there anymore which I could go back
and find where that fold was and kind of bring it out.
But he framed all the way along here and it's it's my own it's my own kind of mistake.
But I want to use this as an example of how you can really trip yourself up, because you can assume
what the mask is going to be and because you can't see it.
Reason why I want to point this out is because what a lot of people will do is they mask that first.
Maybe they'd come to about here, mask that end, and then they just scroll right towards the end and
then mask that in and let Adobe pick up all the movement in the middle and just kind of tweak a.
In between, maybe like, you know, reposition that, reposition here, reposition there and kind of
try and find a happy medium.
But the problem with dealing with that, when you've got something like such an irregular shaped like
a like this, is that it can really you can spend more time almost firefighting and finding the bits
where it doesn't work.
So if you do go through frame by frame, I mean, as I said, that isn't there anymore.
So what I'm thinking of doing is if I got to here and move this back, I'm personally going to start
to slowly relax this this whole crease myself rather than going back.
I can do it myself.
Okay.
Yeah, it's good.
And I'll move along.
Being a man that is being a keyframe, being added every time I change frame and then I skip a frame
and then move along and affect the value.
So.
We can still it's little things like that that the eye doesn't necessarily see.
But if you do follow, I mean, we kind of straightened out now.
So we're kind of we're kind of cool.
So as long as you're kind of staying as close as you can to this and this shape has now changed.
Now we've gone up here a little bit, so paying attention to that kind of thing will really help to
sell the effect.
I just say you don't have to be absolutely dead on the likes of Hollywood like some of Marvel films.
Would do that.
They would go frame by frame and do absolutely every single pixel.
But that's kind of why the production of those films takes not only well, years, really, but also
takes in a full team because something like this, an effect like this, obviously be a lot more intricate
than this, but an effect like this on a scene like this, you'd have one person working on one section
for months at a time to make sure that everything is absolutely as accurate as anything.
And the people who check this work in Hollywood will have just almost like razor sharp focus.
And they know exactly what they're looking for.
Now, here I can see that the whole shape has changed.
So I'm actually spend a bit more time on fit still.
So we got 75% just so I can see what this handle is doing.
And I'm going to just finesse this around.
And he's actually changing shape a little bit there.
So nice shape shifter.
Now that's come out a bit.
So if we drop that in, bring that back a little bit.
The thing is, if you don't necessarily notice something.
You can a change of a shape because it's behind a mask if you don't notice it at the time, if you get
too far along.
You can really trip itself up.
So if you're going to do these effects, I think it's really important.
Just take the time and don't rush it.
Whatever you do, just don't rush it.
If you haven't got the time to do this fact, don't do this fact.
You know, if you're in a project that is very time sensitive and it doesn't really need this effect.
I mean, only you can make that decision.
And on the you can make that call.
But if you think it's an effect that will really highlight and have your client or your audience relate.
Yeah.
Because the thing is, it's the little things like this that really I don't need this point, by the
way, now, so I'm going to hold down control and I'm just going to select it.
You see how it gives me a minus.
Click that it's not deleted, so I don't need that.
So you can add and subtract points all the way along.
But it's only you who can make the decision whether this is needed.
And if it is, if it if it's an effect where you think, oh, yeah, that's for me to going to it's
going to sell it, because quite often audience doesn't necessarily know what they're seeing.
I don't know.
That sounds stupid, but it's true.
Like the amount of effects, the amount of things that I do for clients and they're really shocked where
it's like, Yeah, well you said you want to do this.
And I was like, Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it.
Well, how long does it take?
And they don't necessarily get that like an effect like this.
I mean, this this effect happens over, what, 2 seconds, 3 seconds tops.
And it can take it can take as long or as short as you need it to.
But, I mean, this can take hours, this effect, if you're being absolutely meticulous with it.
And I know it's probably really tempting at this point to just rush it through and and get there, but
I promise you, it is worth it in the end.
Soon as you get you get these handles, Adobe, let me sort it out.
Oh, that was a little bit off, wasn't it?
Let's just bring that down a little bit.
Yeah.
And as I said, this is it really is quite meticulous.
And you can spend so much time on this.
Let's just finish this up.
Nice.
Don't rush it.
This isn't quite right.
Let's move this along.
Maybe use this handle.
Good.
Oh, there we go.
Going up in space there.
A beauty of this is that whenever you change it, it changes in that keyframe.
It doesn't affect the keyframe before.
So, as I said, there's a bit of movement here.
Grab that handle.
Yeah.
Just don't do that.
Alt and bring in.
And I can go back to the previous one and just check out a little bit of bleeding through there.
Again, as I said before, we are going to feather this.
And if you don't really know what I mean by feather, don't worry.
I will explain that I can feather this a little bit.
So you can you can kind of err on the side of caution, go a little bit into him.
Into what you're masking off.
Oh.
That's just a little bit.
Yeah.
Good.
Last few frames now.
I don't think he's going to move up or down that much in these last few frames.
We can just chase him off.
Good.
Off you go, buddy.
They go
and say, well, my friends go, don't get lazy.
And he's pretty much that last little bit there and then he's out.
Okay.
So the it doesn't really matter what the shape of the mask is at the end, just that it's all the way
out.
So we've now must everything if I grab this and bring it in, you know, obviously he's not there anymore.
But yeah, just mass.
They're all out until the out of that and that is now all key frame as you can see all our key frames
for that mask all the way along there.
So what do we do now?
Well, go back to selection tool and we bring the corn.
This opens up the second track, Chris, while I did that before.
And move the corn.
Not there.
It's in shot there.
Let's get fit.
I thought that was more in that clip.
We don't want it there.
What we want, it is right at the beginning of this key frame.
So when this is sized down, it will be you can't quite click on everything at the same time.
Let's go right to the end fact.
Let's just use this and then go to the next.
And that's where he started.
Remember, not the front that he started, but the back.
And we're going to bring this clip and put it right underneath.
And that is it.
Don, want to see it?
So those you fake.
And there he goes.
Now, as you saw this possibly a little bit of he adds a little bit where it's slightly off and this
is where it will really highlight where it is.
Actually, that kind of that works.
It's just the fact that it was so angular.
So what we can do is we can go into here and just to show you what's actually happening.
If I click the path, so it's highlighted and we go to further it's it's set to default at ten but we
can.
Maybe feather a little bit more to take it up to say 40 just for nice eyes.
I would take that back now.
The line is now feathered slightly.
And.
Yeah, okay.
The way you and then.
That works better.
As I said, it all depends on the amount of time you take.
And this is a little bit off now.
We can then use mass expansion if we need to.
Expanding the mass to the right expands it all the way out.
If you're ever so slightly off and you want to bring in if you go to minus.
You can take it if I just reset and take it to minus.
We can expand in or en expand the option to the opposite to expand it.
But if we come in a little bit, it's like maybe minus seven.
Play that back and see how that is.
That works better.
Let me just prevent that, just to give us a full representation of that.
And as you can see that that friend is out really quickly because it's not a massively labour intensive
thing.
That works well.
As I said, it can be as clean or as unclean as you want it to be.
But that is how to do the mask transition.
And as I've already shown you, when used correctly and in the right setting.
It can really just drive that story and just really push it.
Love it.


### 8. Simple Photo Montage

Moving along.
We're now going to do a lovely photo montage.
And it's important to cover this because not all photos are the same.
And it's very rare that you'll get a photo that's this size that you just put everything like this.
How do how do I explain that a bit further?
Well, I've come to machinery and just downloaded a load of images that are happy people, because I
just thought, let's look at happy people today.
So here are all the photos we're going to be using in this photo montage.
And as you can see, most of them are this aspect ratio, which is not six by nine.
No, these are not six by nine, which is the output that we're looking for.
If we right click and we reveal that Explorer and if we take a quick deep dive into this, one of these
images, which they're all the same or most of them are the same aspect ratio, it's 85 6.5504, which
is a standard sensor size, which is three by two.
So remember six by nine, a six across by nine down.
These are three by two.
It's three along, two, two down.
So if you divided this by two, it would be three times that.
That makes sense.
Quite simply, that will not fit right in a in a in a six by nine frame.
So we're going to make sure it does.
Not only that, but these portrait, obviously, these be in landscape.
These portrait images, although are quite possibly then they are the same dimensions.
They're the other way around.
So we're going to need to deal with that as well.
So yeah, so first and foremost, what I want to do in here as I want to get these in an order that
I want them.
And the way to do that is what we've normally done is we've gone for just name order because we brought
in footage that is, you know, pizza oven one, pizza oven two, etc..
What we do here is I'm going to set this down here to user order.
Now, these would have been the speed at the time in which they were brought in, drag them all in together,
and they would have come in at slightly different times.
So what you can do with this is you can move around and you can change the order.
So let's just move these around a little bit.
There's no real reason for me to do that other than to show you that that's what I'm doing and that
you can do that.
But now I have these all in the same order.
There's something else to bear in mind.
So first and foremost, we want to kind of set how long these images are.
And the reason why I'm saying that is because there is a default.
Remember, we've talked about it in the past.
We brought in a graphic or an image and it's gone to a default size on here.
If I go to its timeline, yeah, in here is still image default.
Duration is 1/2.
Well, we kind of want them on for longer than that.
But you see, if I change this default, that will always be changed until I come back.
There's a way around this, and that is if I select the first clip in here, it's going to tell.
So we just look at all of this and control eight.
Select them.
All right, click.
And if we go to speed duration, remember we have that speed duration when we're speeding up and slowing
down clips.
Well, we have a similar dialog in here.
Now, if you're not used to timecode these frames seconds, minutes and hours, and I want it to be
just just 5 seconds, think 5 seconds per image.
Would do me for press.
Okay.
That won't change the default, but it will change the images in here.
So the length of these will now override or overwrite.
Override both will override the default.
So let's just tilted out of there.
I'm just going to come up here and I'm going to create a new sequence.
In fact, let's be good back in here.
Let's close this up.
This is starting to get a bit messy because that motion array have got a lot from them.
Don't forget, there's a link in your worksheet where to get motion away from and all the other plugins
I use sequences and I'm just going to create a sequence in here.
Can either go to new item and sequence or just control and on your keyboard.
Good.
So you remember we've got our sequence presets here and we're going to leave it at 1080 by 25 and I'm
going to put happy people photo montage.
Okay.
Not only does it created in the bin that we're in when we created it, but it's also creates a new sequence
out here just to have things a little bit cleaner.
We had everything here that Pete's from in sequence, so I saved them in images.
They come down to motion away.
I just collected them all.
I mean, images.
And here is our photo montage.
So what I want to make sure is if I click in this way that the user order is in user order.
I'm going to select the top on control A and track these into the timeline.
So all of a sudden, we now have all these very happy people.
And if I play it, each one will be 5 seconds long.
Good.
Happy about that?
Cracking.
So that's the first step.
However, what I like to do is I make the I like to make this a little bit more.
I hate the term cinematic because it's used everywhere.
But we are going to make this a little bit more cinematic.
And we're going to just make these grow slightly.
And the most important thing is to get rid of all of these black bars.
How do we do that?
Well, first and foremost, I need to go and have a look at what the kind of consensus is with black
bars on all these images is in is either twice.
No, my system just was one slider.
So, yeah.
Okay.
They all seem to be.
It's kind of like this size is the first one like that as well.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I'm going to use this as my kind of my master.
My master.
Yeah.
That, the master frame that I'm going to work with and I've go to effects controls with this selected.
Don't forget if you don't have a window and effects controls there and I'm just going to scale this
up ever so slightly, you see how we're 19.6 here?
Oh, by the way, if this came in and it was that big and I mean, they were all that big, what I normally
say is to right click and set frame size.
What we're actually going to do here is we're going to scale to frame size with images.
And in this effect, scale two, frame size works better.
Okay.
So first and foremost, I'm going to scale to frame size.
Okay.
I'm just going to select all these and make sure that they are all scout's frame size as well.
You see how they're all kind of changed a little.
We're going to actually have to do all of them because they've been set like, you know, the scale.
But how can we do it quickly?
Well, we're going to use this a number of times.
I'm going to select this clip, which I know is scaled.
Right.
Oh, the first one.
And I'm going to control and see and I'm going to select everything right click and paste attributes,
or I'm going to hit the shortcut that we made very early on in this course p on the keyboard.
And we want to make sure that motion is selected because scale is within the motion settings in effects
controls.
And if I hit okay, these all should now be scout's frame size.
Good.
Okay, keep that in mind with regards to attributes and pacing attributes, because we're going to be
using that a couple of times.
Good.
So now this is our first clip.
I kind of want I want some I want I want a different image to start.
Actually, I like that.
I like that one.
That's that's quite a nice image.
I prefer that one.
So going to be that's the beginning of sure, I've touched on this before, but just if you need to
move things around and you want to move everything up rather than moving all over and then grabbing
this, you describe this tracker way you want.
And before you let go, hold down control.
You see those buttons, those arrows even, and it shifts everything to the left.
And then you can just close up all these with ripple delete of the space in between.
Good.
So this is our first image, and I'm now going to scale this up until I just clear out all those black
bars and yeah, I'm happy with that.
Okay.
So we're at about yeah.
118.3.
Can we get to one more light?
Just my own sanity.
Yeah.
Okay.
Happy with that fact?
No, we've got.
But no, it's going to have to be 118.3.
Yeah.
That clears that.
In fact I'm just going to go one one.
I know, I know too much sometimes.
Okay.
So I'm happy with that scale up and that's there.
We will happy with that.
Good.
Let's go with that.
So when a copy that, I'm going to select all these.
I know that they're not all the same, but we're working for the majority and then we'll come back in.
So P on the keyboard and paste are attributes motion again.
Good.
Now let's have a quick check through these and.
I'm just pressing down on the keyboard to go to the next clip.
And these are all caught up with that.
Good.
So with that already at that point.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, what we're going to do is we want to I want to create a crossfade across all of them.
Now, we could go here.
And you know what we've done in the past?
We go to here, we highlight that.
And rather than going up to the effects and dragging it down, we do shift D and it creates a crossfade.
Well, we want to do all of them.
Easiest way, hold down control all the way across.
All we've done is highlighted all the edges of each clip shift.
And we've now created a crossfade across all of them.
Okay, good.
Now, the next thing we want to do is we want to create a little bit of movement.
Now, this is my master image, as we've already established, but I'm actually going to go and animate
one of the clip, the images.
So I say clips.
There are effects of the clips.
One of the images in the middle.
And that's because I need to effect that going all the way through this cross dissolve.
Now, okay, granted the one at the beginning, this also has a crust dissolve on it, but it's not
a full crust dissolve because it's only crust is off for the edge.
It's not into another image.
Just let me go back to my mate here because he looks far too happy.
I wish I was as happy as that guy, just generally.
So we're going to come up from 119.
That's going to be our base.
That's where we're starting.
So we're going to toggle a keyframe there and track it off to the very beginning.
And as you see, if I tilt the best we've got, that's where we would have dragged it back to had we
used the first clip.
But because that line delineates the actual crossfade between the clip before we're actually starting
right at the point where this stuffs fade in from this clip, it's that clear cut.
Now the importance of this effect is slow.
We only want a very slow fade.
Slow is better.
So we're starting at 119.
Rather than dragging up and over, I only want a very subtle grow.
So I'm going to go 1 to 5.
That's enough for me.
And then I grab this and I pull it all the way out.
Okay, so it goes all the way through that.
Crossfade.
That would have worked for clip one, image one, but it wouldn't have worked for the first one.
So what are we going to do now?
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
We control and see and we then we copy that and then we pay for pace attributes.
And okay, now, if I come right back to the beginning and click on this.
You see how we can't see.
The key frame.
The key frame can't be seen because it's effectively off the screen.
So.
But it's still there.
It absolutely is.
Still there.
If I go to this and craft that and put up.
Right.
That says it's 119.
A case of that starts from one by night.
But if I go right to here and go right to the top.
It says from 19.2.
That's because this is the beauty and this is the importance of not doing it with the first frame.
The actual transition is starting from off the actual the beginning of the sequence.
If we'd used this and gone to these, say we can see this guy once we'd pasted them all over, this
starting keyframe would have been here and it wouldn't have been growing.
If we look between here.
It would have waited.
You may notice.
You may not notice.
But it would only have started growing once he had fully come in.
If I make that a much steeper growth and play that back through.
You see how it kind of feels like it establishes itself before it starts to grow?
If I do an even bigger zoom, it may highlight it even more.
See how you saw it stopped.
Okay.
So, yeah, I just wanted to highlight why I didn't choose the first one.
I used that one.
Okay, let's go back and let's see where we're at.
As soon as my machine catches up.
So that looks all nice.
Really nice.
Slow crow.
And then we go into the second one and that's a really nice little girl.
However, not happy with that because we're cutting her head off and I'm sure we've got some space above.
So now we've got the zooming in and everything fine.
We can now do things that are correct only to that image.
So I'm going to bring this down a little bit.
Wow.
Look how much I've had to cutting off.
And because I'm not key framing this position.
If I come back now.
You see that?
We had a little bit there because we're zooming in.
So what I want to do is I'm going to pull this scale here.
So that's the starting point.
And.
That's how much food we've got.
So I brought it back up from six, six three, two, six, four one.
By the way, don't forget controls that is undo control shifts.
That is redo track that off.
Now check that.
That's better.
At least we've got more of the top of a head before it gets cut off.
That's good.
I'm happy with a lake.
It's over to the left.
I'm not touching that at all.
Now, this will be sorted in a moment.
So you see how we still got the black bars here?
Black bars here.
This is all okay.
That didn't actually start moving it.
It's just my system was slowing down.
We just play that back again for you so you can say.
See, I was there with you.
St Patrick's Day.
I think everyone celebrates St Patrick's Day.
Really good.
I'm quite surprised how many how many of these images that I actually came across when I said happy
people.
And in fact, I think I said no to number them because they about that.
Everyone was just drinking.
Dancing, fine.
Just drinking.
Is that what makes people happy?
Makes me happy from time to time.
Okay, so what are we going to do now?
Well, we are going to fill in these bits around the back.
And the way in which we're going to do this is it's a lovely little trick, and it means that we don't.
Well, what we could do is you could put a colour.
You could put a colour.
Matt Yeah, you could put a white collar.
Matt underneath there and that would be done.
Yeah.
So move that up to the one above and bring in a colour.
Matt.
And just for argument's sake, to a white collar, Matt, you know how to do all this.
Chuck it in the bottom and drag it out.
I maybe that's what you're going for.
But in all honesty, a white background is just as bland as a black background in something like this.
And that's just not that's just not what we're about, boys and girls.
So what do we do?
Well, rather than drag this up onto the second video track, what we're going to do is we're going
to duplicate it.
Okay.
So we're going to highlight it all.
Remember, hold alt and drag up.
Now you need to make sure that everything's at zero when you drag up.
If you drag to the side, it shows you the offset of, you know, we're offset by 9 seconds and 15 and
we don't want to affect that.
The easiest way to make sure that you're dragging directly up or down is to also hold down.
Shift.
Shift will not let you drag anywhere way of this.
I can go up and down as much as I want, but never over to the side.
I wish I'd known that a while back.
I only learned that in reason.
Well, maybe in the last 12 months.
And it just helps everything.
So still with alt and shift held, let go of your mouse and we now have a second version of this.
Okay.
It looks exactly the same because we're doing.
We're using the exact same thing underneath.
Oh, way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All good.
So how do we then fill in these black bars?
Well, this is the first one I've come across.
And let's see if any have more that's got more black bars in that one.
That's okay.
It's about the same.
That's about the same.
Maybe he's the narrowest.
Maybe.
Is he is this one, though?
I'm going to go with my mate here and his back looks just like my back when I was growing up.
Although that looks like he's gone into a shed.
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to select all of these bottom row.
These are the ones below which you can't actually see right now.
And we're going to nest this clip.
Remember how to nest.
You right click and go to nest or use the show the the shortcut shortcut keyboard shortcut that we that
we set earlier in this this whole course.
And that's N and I'm just going to say that's my image background and hit enter.
Still nothing has happened.
Wait for the magic.
So I'm going to go for scale here.
I'm going to move this up until I cover all the black bars.
See how it can't quite make it.
Yeah.
That's a name that we go to.
To, to.
Oh.
How it won't let us get past that.
People have been asking for ages for Adobe to sort this out.
220 500 Nearly any offer.
228 Okay.
We're all the way out.
And as you can see now, the black bars are filled.
The most important reason why we're nesting this first is because two nest will keep that zoom.
Let me just show you.
See how both of them are zooming.
Let me just.
Let me just show you what would have happened had we not less of that.
I'm just going to hide this for now and say we got this clip and then we zoom this up and we went to
two eight that way.
Maybe.
Oh, maybe not.
Because it was in a nest.
350 okay.
Yeah.
Okay, that's good.
But the problem is we just scaled up and the keyframe.
So if we play it back.
My company is not going to want to show it, but I want to show you.
I just want to show you the absolute horror that this would make if we just left it like that clear
in and out.
And let me show you this.
Oh, that's not the effect we're going for.
And then it goes back to something.
It's not what we want.
So the reason why we did that is, as I've said, so it maintains the growth through all of it.
However, we don't really want that.
That doesn't really want to be staying like that.
So what we do is we come to effects, we come to video effects and we got some blur and sharpen and
we want Gaussian blur.
What I always do, and I know we've used this earlier in the tutorial in the course as we just search
for course simpler and drag that on that bottom nest.
And then we're just going to drag this blurriness up a little bit.
And we're going to make sure that repeats edges is turned on if we don't.
Quite often, if there's not enough image around the end, it just kind of falls off to black or whatever's
underneath it.
Maybe it's another video clip that you're going in and out of or another color map, so you want to
repeat edge pixels.
And I know that my system is struggling, even though this is actually on the images.
I'm just going to pre-rendered this so you can see the final effect.
I'm with that fully rounded out.
Let's have a look.
Now, first and foremost, we don't want.
That first went on.
So I'm going to just pull that back so it doesn't affect the crust as of coming in.
Okay.
So that before where we're halfway through the crust dissolve and there's a bit of yeah, it's not right
because we've got the, we've got the upsize of that behind it.
What we could do is we could always just put a cross dissolve on there as well, which wouldn't really
matter.
It's entirely up to you.
But let's play this back now and obviously we've got a lovely grow through.
We've got the bigger images of these first three behind it, but it doesn't really matter because you
don't see them.
But it keeps the timing and the pacing for all the others.
But as we come to our first portrait image.
It looks lovely, doesn't it?
But for really nice.
Now, what we could do to level the scope even more is on these ones where you are going to see the
edges.
What we could do is we could add a drop shadow.
If we a drop shadow onto this clip and go to 50.
And set the distance and give it a player.
I mean, that could be something.
But don't forget, you can change the colour of the shadow.
So you could always set that to white.
It's almost sitting out in the whites now that whites quite nice, but I'd kind of like it to be softer
but softness coming out the side as well.
So if we take down the softness and maybe reduce the distance, so that's the distance that it comes
from behind the.
And you see how we're kind of a little bit off to the side there now as well.
This is a lot of this is dictated by the size of the image, and the image is actually quite a large
image anyway.
So distances there.
Okay.
Maybe we have to break down the softness just a little bit.
Okay.
Maybe then bring down the opacity.
Just a little.
It's just a little hint, isn't it?
Even now, bring up the softness a bit.
That's nice for me.
And don't forget if that's what you're happy with.
It's good to kind of add a bit of height to these and allow your system to have a bit of time to catch
up.
Because in doing that, you can easily eyeball this because I'm going to control and see and I know
I can see black bars there.
So that's one.
If I hold down shift.
I'm looking for the next one.
No.
That's one.
Let's go down a block or shift from scrolling.
That's one.
And that's why they know it is.
Because that's my mate with my back gate.
And that's less fun.
And if I hit peak and I take off motion and just paste on the shadow.
And as you can see, a few playback.
Everything is moving.
Very lovely, and they've all got that effect on them.
And that is the easiest way to make a fully editable, fully customizable.
Montage just going to bring him back down because I kind of want to see his hat.
Why don't we want to see his hat?
So how do we do that?
We bring in that scale so we know how much we're playing with.
Oh, God, we don't want to miss that hat.
Then we go back.
So it's always good to look back through and just check that we've got everything in frame how we want
it.
And we've got my mate.
And he looks even happier than ever now.
He's slowly growing and no problems with anything.
This is lovely.
I'll have images that pull focus.
It's great that, isn't it?
And looking through these are all looking great, aren't they.
Happy with that framing.
She's literally living life.
I kind of like to see him a little bit more if I've got the room.
So again down here, bring that down.
Oh yeah.
There's loads more.
They see why it's important just to come through.
You set everything, so it's not that hard to just make a slight change.
And that works.
That works.
I'd like a bit more of their heads or his head.
He looks like he's got a fine head of hair and I'm definitely want to see that.
Definitely not jealous
again with this one.
Kind of want a little bit more.
We've got some room down here to kind of calm down and still have the suggestion of drinking.
Everyone's happy and.
Yeah, good.
We've been through as my.
Oh, my, he's so cute.
Everything that's good.
I'm happy with that.
The focus is right there in the centre and.
Yeah, great, lovely.
And don't forget, you can make this not just for six by nine.
You could make this for one by one.
You know, you could do it ten, ten, 80 by 1080.
And following these whole things, these, these settings, you could apply to any size a sequence that
you've got and apply that with and any image that doesn't quite fit you just nested all below and put
on that causing blur and all moves up together.
Nice, easy, lovely, tranquil, slow photo montage.


### 9. Blurring Out Faces

So Antoine, next little tidbits and I love this one and it's so much easier to do it in in modern times,
as it were, with updates from Premiere.
So yeah, that starts as we mean to go on.
Let's create a new sequence just to touch on when the sequence has been on.
I'm just going to control an end for new and I'm going to just title this bird out face boom.
Let's go to that one.
And they have taken the liberty to select some footage which is titled Young, Creative, Multiethnic
Team of Stupidly Low Number.
So what is the premise for this?
Well, first and foremost, just want to make sure we set the frame size yet.
And this is if you ever have footage that you need to blow someone's face out of, you can do this with
options.
But the engine in in premiere and the the technique I'm going to use in this section is mainly it faces
because the engine is just so good or better.
That's not me.
Let's not over promise better at tracking faces.
So we've got this footage here, which is of a team in a work environment.
And it turns out this woman right here is actually the chief analyst for MI5.
And we realized that we can't show her face, but we need to show the rest of the footage.
So how do we sort that out?
Well, let's find a nice, clean frame that we're happy with.
I'm happy with this frame here where we can see all her face and we're just going to come over to Effects
and we're going to look search for Mosaic.
And we don't want in or outs that we thought might not even be in yours.
That's obviously from presets that I've downloaded, but we want this stylized mosaic.
Okay, so let's just drop it on.
And there you go.
You can't.
You can't recognize her.
So they go, We're done.
What can I say?
Obviously, we're not done.
So that's now drop the mosaic over the whole clip in the effects controls.
So we need to cut out a certain little bit.
And there's a reason why I've done this now rather than before, and that's because we're used to using
masks.
Now, if we were to use a mask like we did before in Opacity, we're going to start as a starting point.
It's going to be the lips if we click that.
Well, yeah, okay.
We're masking, but we're masking everything out and we're keeping the mosaic so we undo that.
And as you can see under Mosaic, we also have these options.
So if we select a little crackin done and that's how you only joking.
I mean, if only me today.
So yeah, this is the Ellipse tool and that's who we want to cover.
So first and foremost, there's a lot of blocks there and we kind of want it a little bit finer.
So I'm going to drag this down.
Well, we don't want one.
We don't want to let's say we want four and let's say maybe four vertical blocks as well.
No, maybe not.
Let's go higher.
Oh, yeah.
Cause the higher the number idiot.
Let's go to 40 and let's go for the.
I knew there was a four in there somewhere.
I am, I am reading my notes from so as you can see we've got smaller blocks because we've got a lot
more horizontal, a lot more vertical.
And that just makes it a little bit better than just a big, big chunky thing, like she's in Fortnite.
So first and foremost, we need to resize this.
So we just grab a little handle and we bring this down.
So we're covering her face and hair as well.
Thing is the Ellipse tool.
It gives you a great starting position, but the minute that you move one of the actual handles, you'll
see that it obviously moves everything.
But I'm I'm quite happy with that.
That's that's a good place to start.
So this starting point and we've got a nice clean version of the face blurring in what I mean by that
is if I just turn off the effects, it's right around her face.
That's kind of where we want now.
This is where we use the magic of tracking.
Remember when I hit the wrong button before?
That's not what I want to do here.
I want to mask the path and I want to track that mask.
So something that's kind of sped everything up massively in premiere pro of recent years is that preview
isn't automatically on.
Okay, I would always double check that and make sure that preview is turned off.
The reason why is it used to be on by default and you couldn't turn it off?
I don't even think it was in the options there.
And what it did was it previewed every single frame and it took a lot longer because rather than just
finding the information itself and kind of storing that for when it's finished tracking it literally
had to render out each and every frame as it went and it took ages.
So here we are.
We're in here.
We've got the mask puff here.
I'm just going to track.
So I am yeah, I'm going to keep position scale in rotation because her position kind of stays the same.
Yeah, but the scale rotation doesn't.
In fact, you know, I don't think we get any closer to her, do we?
Let me just just kind of put a mark here marking on a clip is just m well selected if nothing selected,
remember.
And it makes a mark in the timeline.
I'm just making a mark there because that's where that mask is made up to.
But she doesn't really get that.
She doesn't really move.
She keeps the same distance to the camera.
So yeah, okay, maybe I'll make it even easier.
So I'm going to say position and rotation, position, position and rotation.
And then we're just going to track forward as we play button here and we just let it do its thing.
And as I said, it goes a lot quicker than it used to this literally this amount where we're going.
But 9 seconds to that give or take, is about 10 seconds.
That would normally take about anything from about 2 to 3 minutes.
Whereas as you can see, this this is taking, what, 20, 20, 30 seconds tops.
And I mean, that's done.
I was pretty, right.
Let's just see where we're at.
That looks good.
That's kind of off her a little bit and good.
But that doesn't do anything.
Why doesn't it do anything?
Well, that's because if you look here, all these key frames have been generated for every single frame
from where we tracked, but we tracked forward and we started halfway through the clip.
So how do we do the rest?
I know that we haven't.
We need to kind of play around with that.
But let's get the base in here and buy to track backwards.
We just put the play had before and we rather than hit back, which is what I hit in the previous section,
we go to the next key frame, which is the key frame we started with, and then we just track backwards.
And again, this will be nice and quick.
And I know I said it took about 2 to 3 minutes in normal.
It could have even taken longer to pass it, depending on the size of your footage.
And if you imagine if you've got to do this a number of times in a project.
I you know, time takes my time costs money.
And yeah, it's all about that time versus money thing.
We've been there before.
Good.
Somehow people that don't really need it there because a face isn't in.
So let's see how this plays back first without doing anything.
That's following her quite well.
You couldn't distinguish, so you couldn't recognize her.
He crosses in front of her, his hand comes across her bit.
But that's fine.
She's definitely hidden from view.
I would say you definitely couldn't recognize her from that.
However, we can do something else as well.
I'm going to actually pick a point where maybe she's a little bit.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
So going to mask this path and I'm just going to drag this down a little bit.
So what that's done is that's effective.
But keyframe.
That we were at now free.
I'm just going to put up Mark there so I can mark which key frame I play with.
If we play that forward now, that's going to jump.
You see how it jumped out because it jumped back to the other key frame.
So what we can do now is if we track forward again from here, we can overwrite the previous keyframes.
And just like before, it just adds that little bit more information.
Remember, everything up until this point was tracking from this frame that we selected and it was changing
its aspects because of where she'd moved.
But it was still using this frame here as its source, as its reference point.
But that looks much better and yeah, good.
I'm happy with that.
What I'm also going to do remember when we looked at this, let me just tell and then when we looked
at this in the past and I said this was just a center thing, what this can do, rather than having
to go down here and grab for your father, this is actually a handle for your father.
So you can actually pull this out a little bit and just feather it out.
Sometimes that kind of just it just gives that little bit more.
And don't forget, we can always expand the mask if we want.
Obviously, we don't need to do it that much, maybe to about we're about there, obviously.
Now, if that's the only thing you wanted to keep, you wanted to blur out everything else, you can
invert it.
So there she is.
And she's being kept.
But we won't do that.
In fact, it's sometimes fun to check if that's what you're actually masking out, if that's her.
So let's take off that inversion and that.
Is almost it.
Don't really need it before then.
So what we can do is if we go back frames just to where she's there, what I want to do is I want to
kind of find out where that's where she's kind of starts to become it again at the beginning.
So what I'm going to do is I want to go in here and I'm going to delete these key frames.
I'm going to zoom in a little bit.
I'm going to delete.
Those key frames to Tilda out of there, and let's just make sure the path is on there again.
I'm going to just slowly adjust.
With my scroll wheel on my mouse.
And just ever so slightly.
Tweak it around this hand.
See, the thing is, a lot of time when you're you when you watch and like stuff like this on the news,
it's done really quite crudely.
And that's because they don't really have time.
They've got to turn around the news, you know, in a in a in a matter of hours, if not minutes.
If you got the time.
When you see documentaries there already, they're always blurred out better.
And that's purely because they have more time.
They have more time in that budget.
I'm just going to add a point there and just bring her up.
Bring that up.
Bring that whole thing.
Good.
Just want to close this off now.
Keep coming.
Skip about three or four frames.
Good with that.
And I know that by the time we get to there, she's she's completely.
Yeah, she's covered.
All you can see is glasses.
So good.
I'm going to leave up there and I tell out what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this, okay?
And then I'm going to make a cut or I'm going to trim the end of this.
At that point, I'm going to come down to the bottom one and I'm going to delete this mosaic.
Just delete it all the way off.
And if I put a crossfade on this by selecting the end and controlling shift to add that crossfade that
then comes in at that point, it comes a little bit too late.
It might be because the crust is off takes too long.
But you see how we're just we're only introducing it when it needs to be there.
Here we go.
Just check that beginning again.
We see her through.
That's okay.
I'm thinking if.
If enemy forces say, but as you can see, the actual engine has done really well to track her.
And get it all the way through.
You won't be able to identify her from that.
And the agent's identity is safe.


### 10. Tracking Graphics (Intro to After Effects)

Okay.
So the time has come, and I can't lie to you.
This is what we're going to need to do.
In this section, we're going to look in aftereffects.
But first and foremost, I'm going to make the case for why you need to use it.
Firstly, what we're going to do in this can it starts at there's a new plugin out there which can work
within Premiere Pro and kind of do what we need to do within Premiere Pro.
However, first and foremost, that's a paid plugin which I have no problems with, with showing you
paid plugins and how they work and if I rate them.
But the thing is, is that the only reason that you would you would want to get use a plug in and pay
for a plug in would be if you don't want to use after effects.
And the thing is the price of the paid plugin is less than the step up from your subscription to Premiere
Pro or use as your step up from your subscription just for Premiere Pro to the suite.
So the difference would not only get you after effects, which is needed for the advanced version of
this, but also the whole suite.
So in all honesty, it's a no brainer.
And the tracking in After Effects is brilliant.
The tracking in Premiere Pro isn't the greatest.
I mean, it worked here, but this was a phase.
And depending on what we're going to track in this section, we're going to need aftereffects.
So.
But don't worry.
Get your drink of choice, hot beverage, something like that, and get yourself comfortable, because
that's what we're going to do in this section.
And I promise you, by the end of it, you will know what you need in after effects to be able to achieve
this.
And then we may just spend a little bit more time in after effects because as I said earlier in this
course, a good editor, a good editor at least has the basic knowledge of after effects.
And I will show you how to open this in after effects.
And with Dynamic Link, it makes it so easy.
But anyway, first and foremost, let me show you what we're going to be doing in this.
We can be using this footage.
I'm going to alt and drag this because that's what we're going to use.
She's no longer we identified a completely wrong and she's actually an accounting firm for a business.
But you know what?
Let me cut this because I'm going to set a new sequence and we're going to call this tracking advance.
And I've called it tracking graphics in an actual course because we are going to track graphics, but
we need something to track.
And tracking is simply setting a point, some kind of reference point in a video and tracking its movement,
just following its movement and doing something with the information that that movement gives us.
So this lady here, as I said, she's in accounting.
However, this guy here is Tableau eight.
Yeah.
We need to identify him because we're the bad guys now.
Oh, that's awful to think.
So what I want to do is I want to track him and put his name next to him.
Let me see what happens when we don't track and we just put his name next to him.
So let's say this is Jimmy Flake rather than James Blunt.
And it would help James Blunt.
James Bond.
And it would help if I could spell that.
This is Jimmy Blake.
He's renowned throughout the world as the second best spy.
So that's my text.
I'm meaning him.
So good.
Jimmy Blake.
That doesn't really work, does it?
I want to have that part of him.
Okay.
So the way in which we would do this in premier is we would find somewhere where we like maybe have
him as he's looking at her.
And let's place this text kind of where we want.
We've got into the essential graphics panel.
Don't forget, if you don't see it, it's just window and essential graphics.
And let's change the size of this and the font.
I'm going to go for Korea.
Because that's, like, really spy, isn't it?
And I'm going to skirt down ever so slightly.
Do we have a bold career?
Yeah, that's good.
Make that happy.
Okay, so that's Jimmy Blake.
And what we want to do is we want to keyframe this motion.
Now, do we keyframe the vector or do we keyframe the actual motion?
Doesn't really matter.
To be completely honest.
And in here, just to kind of do belt and braces in here, we have all the information that's in here
to remember like in the collar where you also had limit you color on the hair.
It just adds it all here just so you got it.
So if you don't have this to hand handling you just in here, it's just there.
It's just part of it.
It adds it in.
So with that in mind, we're going to actually keyframe the motion of this.
So as we've done in the past, we need to toggle on the keyframe for position.
Now, what I would love would be for something to come up here to start tracking, but it doesn't.
And that's the real annoyance.
So what we need to do is, okay, his head is moved a little bit, so we now need to move it.
Now we could use these.
However, if we select motion, you get the bands all the way around the boundary bands and you've got
the the anchor point right there.
So we know we can move it.
So if we move it a little bit better, okay, he's moved his head a bit higher and.
I know you probably know this, but I'm not really trying to sell their specs because I'm actually trying
to show how clunkier as he moved his head down a little bit there and then kind of moved to that.
And that's a little bit frustrating.
And like you say, it's not.
It's not the greatest.
And until Premier come up with a point where you can easily track movement.
I will forever say we need to go to aftereffects.
So with that in mind, let's open after effects.
And just to reiterate, if you don't have after effects installed, as you can see, I have like, well,
Photoshop Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom Premiere Pro After Effects.
I have two versions of Lightroom character animator, audition, media encoder and Camera that parts
of Premiere Pro anyway.
But yeah, if you don't have it, it will be down here available in your plan.
I mean, look at all the things I don't currently have downloaded.
Mm hmm.
But if I can teach myself fresco.
No, that's.
I think it's been a mobile app, actually, although it does say desktop.
So, yeah, you go down here, install it, and then you're good to go.
So let me show you after effects.
And first and foremost, you're greeted with a splash screen and this says, Welcome, Emma.
It's because it's onto our company and my wife.
So all we have men.
But yeah, I'm still Adam.
And you'll excuse the fact that I blurred out all down here.
But that's confidential information for my clients.
So before you do anything in Premiere Pro to get through AfterEffects, let's start a new project.
Okay.
And you don't really have to do anything.
Well, not yet.
But the minute that you actually bring something over to After Effects, it kind of.
Well, yeah, it kind of wants you to do stuff.
Let me just get this to kind of how you would have it.
Yeah, that's kind of how you'd have it.
So what I'm I to do is I'm actually going to go to file and I'm going to go new project.
However, there's nothing really you can do in here until you do bring over stuff from after effects.
So now that I've got that, yeah, it's okay.
And please don't be daunted by this.
Let me just size this up because I don't usually use this in this setup.
I have an ultrawide and that really shouldn't be that big, but we'll deal with that when we come back
into After Effects.
So here we are in Premiere Pro.
And first and foremost, I'm going to select where.
I what I want to take into aftereffects.
And there's a there's a reason for this.
So I'm going to put that there.
That's I don't want this last little bit and aftereffects and let's just scrap back I'm going to start
tracking him from about, let's say, here.
So I'm going to cut and I'm going to duplicate.
The reason why I duplicate this is because once you take this into aftereffects, this is going to be
overwritten and you can't do anything again with it in Premiere Pro.
I mean, you can always go and get the original file, bring it in, but if you imagine you got a massive
sequence, you got loads of stuff in here, just best practices to duplicate it.
You can always get.
You can always put these cuts back.
I like to leave them.
I like to leave the cuts there just so it kind of lines up perfectly and I know exactly what I'm doing.
However, if you ever want to delete a cut, I don't think I've shown you this before.
I may have.
If you ever want to delete a cut, you just hold down control.
Remember when we highlighted that at a transition?
Well, if you just delete, if it's the same clip, it gets rid of the cut.
Magic.
I'm going to do that because I always like to keep that and to get this into after effects.
Once it's installed, you just simply right click and replace with after effects composition.
Don't panic.
I'll hold your hand all the way.
Let's go.
And now?
Now it wants to go and save a project again.
Please excuse the blurring.
Now, William Blair.
And this is where we've been working.
So video in here is all the other stuff that we've made.
Images.
There's lots of them, although it's not showing because it's only saving type as an after effects project.
And what I like to do here is I like to go into animations.
That's why we created that in the first place.
So going to double click into that and then I'm going to name this project.
I'm going to name this tracking Tableau eight.
Okay, cool.
Or whatever you like, but good print.
So as you can see, it's brought in our footage and loaded it up.
Not only that, but over in here, see project.
If I come up to here, we've got Project Bean here project.
So that's kind of similar.
We have two things here which can actually be drawn back to Premiere Pro.
So here's our footage.
Young.
Ethnic team.
Young.
Come on.
What?
What the name was.
Young, creative, multi-ethnic team of.
So there's our footage and here is our comp.
What's a comp?
A comp is a composition.
All it's just referred to in the industry as a comp.
But what that is, is a sequence.
It could also be argued that it's a nest for in this.
Right now it's just like a sequence just like we've got tracking advanced in here we have it here doesn't
really do a great job of sorting out the folders here, although you cannot folders, but I'm just not
going to bother with this.
So let's get this just looking a little bit more presentable.
Okay, so I'm going to right click and reset to save layout.
I'd love to get that over because that's not supposed to be all the way over there because I like to
work in here.
How can I get that?
Okay.
Yeah.
So, yeah, we don't I don't normally have all that open when I'm in a smaller, a smaller screen so
we can toggle between these.
But I don't think we really need to for now.
We've got different informations here, but we don't really need those.
Okay, so on here you can see that we've got our.
Video track.
If we skip forward, if we zoom out a little bit, alt and scroll down just like you would in Premiere
Pro and this is our entire work area.
Now, that's what this is called.
This is a work area.
If you wanted to shorten this.
Just to show you the name.
If this wasn't correct and you wanted to actually be here and you wanted to get rid of everything,
you would right click and trim, come to work area, which is this work area set just to kind of give
you an idea of what that's there.
And also just to highlight the these little marks and these marks that we placed here, one there and
one there.
Well, those have come through as well, which is great.
And most things that you add in Premiere Pro will come in after effects as well.
If you've got a color grade, the color grade will be in there.
If you've applied a lot, the lot will be there as long as you have the lot saved in the backend in
after effects as well.
But that's that's way down the line.
Also, just look, this has now changed.
This is now our project underscore one linked comp zero one tracking to below eight.
So what that's done is that has provided that name because if we if we go backwards tracking to eight
that's what we've called this linked comp zero one is what this is linked to comp zero one and our projects
because the whole project, not the sequence, but the project is our project.
Okay.
So it does label a lot for you just as a side.
I said it ages ago, but a color mat in after effects is a solid.
Okay, and this is what I wish Premiere Pro did.
If you wanted to add a solid that already comes up white solid.
If I change the color to say that color or color direction that is well, it's magenta and it's already
named it.
I just I just.
I just wish really.
Which Premiere Pro did that?
Okay, so what are we doing here?
Well, first and foremost, we need to track some movement.
Okay.
But let's get some text in first.
Yeah, let's just.
Let's just do some simple text.
Just simple, simple text.
So we got to here to our type tool.
And just like in Premiere Pro, when you start typing on here, it creates a graphic here.
When you click here, it's created a graphic.
It's created an empty text layer.
The difference being is that this creates a layer, not a clip, and it's created it for the entirety
of your work area.
Bear that in mind.
Right.
What was this guy's name?
Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Did you say bland?
If I didn't, I should have done.
Now that that text is done, I'm going to go back to the selection tool.
And this is white.
We don't want it white to a it black.
Well, we can just easily just go black if we need to.
Those are the colors over here.
If we wanted a different color, we would go to here and we would color we could pick our color.
But I'm quite happy with it.
Just being black.
Okay.
We had it as courier, so I'm going to change the font.
Courier.
And what's happening there?
That's not what we want, is it?
No, it really isn't.
I should change it to.
Korean you, they go, that's better.
That was if you ever have anything like that, it's a fund that has gone corrupt.
And they it happens all the time.
So frustrating.
But don't worry.
Just easily just sort itself out and either redownload it or select something else which is enabled
pretty much the same because that's exactly what that is.
And so Korea began.
The Korea planned Jimmy Bland and that's him.
So, okay, if I play this through now, well, we've just got Jimmy Bland.
But we need to now track him.
Okay.
So what I'm going to do, the reason why I selected right here is because I've already kind of decided
what I'm going to track.
I'm not going to track his head.
And that's because once he comes into frame.
He moves around a little bit, but his head moves a lot.
What I'm actually going to track is this little insignia thing on his on his on his chest.
Okay.
So I'm going to start right at the beginning.
In fact, I'm not going to start midway through like we've done in the past, and I'm going to track
this.
Also, the reason why I want to track this, let me just zoom in.
Oh, did you see that?
Yeah.
You can zoom up and down with your scroll wheel in after effects.
Not only that, but if you hold down spacebar, you can move around without actually moving it.
You know, like in here, if we were in motion and we moved around, it would move it around.
And that's actually one that's our comp on top of our clip.
It would move it around the actual area.
Not so much in here.
You can move things and I will deal with that in a later section.
But this is purely holding down alt and scrolling up and then holding down spacebar moving around.
This is purely because this is a composite thing software and it needs to be able to do this and you
need to be able to get in and move around easier.
That's why certain times when I'm in Premiere Pro, I really struggle purely because I just, i, i
the things are different between the two and sometimes premiere pro is just nice and simple and it's
good, but sometimes in after effects you can just deep dive and dial in a lot easier.
Anyway, I want to track this.
So what we need to do is we need to open up our tracker.
If you don't see it on the right hand side, which is here, you just go up to window and select your
tracker there.
Okay.
And the motion source is you can creative.
Now, that would have actually already been selected had I had it selected in the actual timeline or
the work area.
Okay, let's just move this round so I can see where he is now.
And what's been created is we've actually gone down into the layer, not into the comp.
Okay.
So we've kind of deep dived rather than being in the nest outside the nest as if it were a nest.
We've gone into the clip.
Okay.
And that's why we're now going to I need to hold on spacebar to move around.
Sorry I've got on done alt.
For some reason my thumb had gone over and we want to track this.
So what we want to do in this is we want to track the motion.
We want to track the camera or a track the motion of this.
So let's select track motion and we're given this box.
What does this box mean?
Well, first and foremost, if you grab anywhere in the middle box, but not the actual cross.
It will start moving around.
Not only that, but the minute you start moving, it starts to magnify.
You see how I'm going over and it's magnifying things.
That's because it's helping you dial in exactly what you want.
And what I want to do is I want to track the top of that.
These why I've picked this as well as because there's a little bit of contrast.
There's a color change between these two and that's what I want to track.
Now, these two boundary boxes are important when you're tracking.
The smaller they are, the slower it may track, but the more accurate it will be.
Because what you're telling this is what I want to track is right on this X within this box.
However, keep an eye on this box in cases.
A lot of fast movement, and I need you to consider that this has possibly come outside this box.
But don't worry about anything outside this box.
This isn't all the way through, but this is from one frame to another.
So with that in mind, as I said, the smaller they are, the slower it may be to track.
The bigger they are, the faster it may be to track.
However.
The less accurate it may be because it's looking at more pixels per frame.
Before we go any further.
We need to go to options.
And I don't know why, but by default this says if confidence is below 80%, adapt the feature.
That means as we move from frame to frame.
If the software engine, which is actually called Sensei to if Sensei too has less than 80% confidence.
Adapt feature.
Short shorthand for that feature.
Well, just plug it or take a guess.
I don't want it to do that.
I want it to stop tracking.
I don't know what content will continue.
Tracking is kind of what it says.
Extrapolate motion not to show.
I always just say Stop tracking.
Just literally stop everything.
Tell me why you're having problems.
I'll go back and fix it.
Okay.
So let's press.
Okay.
Let's try and track this.
Now, remember when we were tracking the reason why I left this up?
Remember when we were tracking this and we clicked forward and back on here to track?
Well, it's very similar in here in as much as we have these.
We play backwards, play for, analyse backwards, analyse forwards.
This is track selected musk forward.
Backward.
This is by frame and this is by frame.
Similar in here.
Track it back by frame.
That's when you may be having a real problem and you kind of just need to really, you know, sort itself
out.
So we're going to go with position here because nothing really changes and it doesn't really rotate.
However, if things were rotating and you need to get that 3D space, you'd also turn on rotation and
you begin the second track point.
We're not going to do that for this story and scale.
Similarly, it would bring up a second point.
So just kind of undo that, undo that, undo that, get rid.
And we're just going to use this one track point.
Okay.
You ready?
Okay.
First and foremost, we're going to track backwards.
So let's play it backwards and see how it does.
Bearing in mind that if confidence is below 80%, we start tracking, we can turn this.
We can change that up to 90% or 100%.
But 80% is a good starting guide.
So let's track backwards and see how it does.
How good's that?
Literally in that short space of time, it tracked all the way back.
If we want to see those key frames, if we select the.
The site where we're tracking on the video.
If we select what we're tracking and press you on the keyboard, those are all key frames.
But you see how it's three lots of key frames because it's added the feature center, which is that
feature center, the confidence which is the confidence that we set or we allowed to set default 80%.
And the attach point, which is also how it's reading the feature center.
So what we want to do is want to go to the and the reason why of 12 these down is because if you recognize
this, this not only these, I mean, we have a square key frame rather than a a diamond's key frame,
but it's very much the center.
But we have these and these are what we had here.
Key frame, move to the next one.
Same here.
Key frame moves the next one.
So what we want to do is want to get to the very end one.
So that's where we started our track and we want to continue through to track the rest.
So let's press play and see how it does there.
Okay.
So now it's stopped.
So it's lost confidence.
And that's probably because he's turned slightly and this has become a lot brighter.
And there's actually a tinge of cyan on there.
And I noticed it over here as well.
And that is a big bugbear of mine.
It's called chromatic aberration, but that's down to of us who have captured this footage and not me.
So it will, if that's okay, let's just continue and see how it goes.
Arcades moved off a little bit there.
So let's go back to where we saw it.
Move off.
It's down the bottom.
Travelled up from.
Okay.
Still not quite there.
Where did it come off when he moved?
Okay.
So what we do now is we kind of go a little bit frame by frame to just check where we're at.
So I'm going to go up and down.
I'm going to go forward and back with frames.
Now in Premiere Pro, we go left and right with our cursors.
Yeah, we don't do that in after effects.
We use page up and page down, which can be a little bit counterproductive when you get in here.
But don't worry, you will get used to it.
So page down, let's say.
Okay, that's still on there.
We're looking at this X here and around the top of this insignia page down again, starting to move
a little bit.
So I'm going to move it up.
I'm going to try and track from there.
It's still not quite right.
Okay, so let's come back again.
That's good.
That's good.
That's good.
That's good.
I'm happy with all that.
Okay.
That's where it comes off.
So let's move that up there.
I'm going to change this confidence to confidence below 90%.
Okay.
I'm also going to close this down.
Close this box down and close this box down as well.
I only want it looking.
I don't want it to confuse itself with down here as well.
So let's try again.
Okay.
That's good.
Now, don't worry about your confidence.
That's fine.
Keep going.
That wasn't too great.
Let's go back.
I'm going out with Paige up there.
I'm happy with that.
Oh.
Make sure you're not dragging a key frame.
You're actually dragging the box.
Go from there.
And they just track for the frame.
So what this does is, rather than going to the next this is just this is just tracking and analyzing
as it goes forward, just to check that we're on the right path.
And we are.
Sometimes you need to do this.
You need to literally go frame by frame just to check that the engine is going right.
And so things don't get too complicated.
Oh, we're at the end.
Oh, good.
I don't know if you noticed, but some of these facades disappear.
It only keeps a certain amount of them on at any one time.
Okay, so that's where we trapped from.
That way we wanted to trek from.
Let's check back now and just check back here just to check if we can just do that quickly.
No.
There's a reason why I didn't want to track there, so I just undone that.
And that's exactly what I want.
Everything is good.
We're good.
Now, before we do anything else, I want to edit the target.
And to do that, I'm going to create a null.
Okay.
But no object is literally nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
It's a it's an invisible thing that we just use to control other things.
I'll show you what I mean.
So our target is the null.
We could do it to Jimmy Bland, but we're going to do it to the null.
And there's a reason for that, and I'll explain that very soon.
But we just press, okay.
And then we hit apply.
We're asked apply dimensions X and y.
X is across wise up.
Yes.
The options are x only or Y only.
I don't really know why you never do that, but you just.
Okay.
Put.
So that tracking is there.
See this red box?
This is our null.
Okay.
Let's just zoom out a little bit.
And there's Jimmy Bland up there.
And now if we leave our null selected and we go forward, you see that the null is now moving with it.
It's a box and it's got an anchor point at the top left.
Doesn't really matter, to be honest with you.
All we now need to do is we need to decide where we want Jimmy Bland, the name to be.
I'll happy with it being there.
We can always edit it because all we're doing is we're adding the tracking motion and if we leave it
there, we're happy with that.
That's all we need to do is grab this down here.
Now, this is a pick whip.
And what we're saying is that we want the parent of this to be something else.
Please don't switch off.
Don't switch off mentally.
There's a parent and there's a child.
Okay.
And arguably, if nothing is affecting something, it's a parent because it makes its own decisions.
Okay.
Whereas if it's a child, something else is affecting at least one aspect for it.
And in this case, we want to make this text Jimmy Bland, the child of the null, because the null
has all the information.
See all this check points here?
If I select the no and press you, we now have the position keyframes in here, which is the translation
of all the tracking data from the tracker, from the video.
You still with me?
Okay, let's pick up on what we want to do is this is come up here because we have pressed you to show
all key friends.
However, if we have a back up and in twirl it down, we're given options off of anchor point, position,
scale, rotation, opacity.
There's a shortcut to get to position.
And the shortcut is quite simply, if we go up with it, select it.
We hit P.
Why would you only want to get position?
Well, if you can imagine if there's loads of stuff on here, you kind of only want to be seeing what
you want to see.
And in this case, all we want to know is our position.
So we grab this pick whip and we drag this down to the position and we let go and it throws it back
to us because it doesn't matter with a no what we're pick whipping, we pick whip the null.
Okay.
I'm showing you that there because there's a number of things that you will do if you do embrace after
effects.
There's a number of things that you do where you'll pick whip one thing to another.
And sometimes you need to pick, whip it to a certain aspects, a certain element.
Whereas with a no, you pick whip to the actual know and let go a quick well, not a quick away, but
the manual way to do it would be to drop this down and say, I want the parent to be No.
One the same thing.
I just like the animation of the pick whip.
It's great.
Well, nothing's happened.
Well, yes, it has.
If we press play now.
The text now moves with Jimmy Blunt.
It's good, though, isn't it?
And how well is that tracks from that point?
Why don't we track it from before?
Well, first and foremost, I knew it was going to be difficult.
Secondly, what I want to do is I want to put an animation on this to bring it in.
How do I do that?
Well, as I said, you created when you created this text, it created the whole thing all the way across.
So we first need to shorten this off.
Okay.
So there's two ways to do it.
You can either pull up from the beginning just like you would in Premiere Pro, or what you can do is
you can go out and close parentheses, which is the one just to the right of p square bracket.
And what that does is it shortens it at the beginning.
But unlike in Premiere Pro with cue, it deletes everything and brings it back in here.
It just cuts it off where you set it.
So before we don't have Jimmy Plant.
I know it comes up.
Jimmy Blunt.
Okay.
So now we could we want to animate this texture.
So if we wanted to do just a simple fade in.
We brought up position by pay to bring up the opacity.
What letter do you think?
No, you don't use.
Oh, you use tea.
Of course you do.
I dunno why.
What is 000.
Just something I don't really know.
So let's just leave it alone.
So te brings up our past thing.
And I remember that because it's opacity.
Yeah, you're welcome.
So how do we affect the opacity?
Well, it's quite simple.
We.
Just.
Sort that out.
What's that?
That's a keyframe.
We're now going to go forward five frames.
In fact, we're going to go forward 15 frames.
To do that, we hold down shift.
And as we did in Premiere Pro, we would.
Pressed to the right on our cursor.
One, two, three times.
That's five, ten, 15.
In aftereffects, we use page down five, ten, 15.
What we want to do is we want to create another keyframe.
Okay, good.
So what do we do now?
Well, if we look at our opacity, bizarre opacity, but we haven't got anything to be able to change
it.
Well, no, that's because it's down here.
And down here is the expand or collapse the transfer controls pane.
This is always up by default.
I closed it off before because I'm used to a much bigger screen.
I mean, if I if you see what's on that screen now, if I go to full screen, that's how much room I
have.
So I usually have all of them open all the way along.
And I don't really know the difference, but because I'm constraining this to 16 by nine, so can be
viewed on most devices, I'm all the way over here.
So I feel a little bit bunched then.
Anyway, we have our opacity key frame there and our plasticky frame here.
What we don't want to do is track this down now.
Why?
Well, because for some reason, these two are now selected because they're both bloop click out, get
rid of them.
If we brought that down to zero, we have brought that one down to zero as well.
So on this first keyframe, we now pull this down to zero and we're faded out.
And if we now press spacebar playback.
We at the end.
Let me just go to Fitz now so he can say it properly and maybe go past Jimmy Bland.
See him at Sam.
And then just before we get to the end, we're going to hit another key frame for the opacity played
a little bit longer and then just take it to zero.
Okay.
So we've got zero capacity, zero capacity, 100% capacity, 100% capacity.
And so we we effectively put a phased in.
Keep him on tracking him as he moves.
And then we fade out.
Now, if you want to take a break, this will be a good time to take a break.
Okay.
Because I want I'm going to build on this now while we're in here.
We're going to build on it.
And this kind of this whole chapter will be your Bible for this kind of thing in aftereffects.
But I'm really going to build on this now.
So if you want to take a break, I would take a break now and take 5 minutes.
Take 10 minutes.
Don't take too long, because we're going to build on what you've just learned.
But you take a break now and come back to me when you've recovered.
So before we move on from here, let's just jump quickly back to our premiere pro and go to tracking
events.
That's what we're in.
And this is now.
How it plays out.
Or it doesn't pass because we need to save this controller ness.
That should all save up.
And we have 4 seconds in here and that now.
Well, pick up.
Here we go.
Jimmy Plant.
And there he is.
Now, this is quite labor intensive on here because not only is it bringing through this, it's also
bringing through the video.
And we don't need the video.
If I just tap back to here and turn this off, disable this.
So the video isn't all of this as well.
So if I turn off this video, it goes and it goes there.
But the text is still there.
It's black, so we can't see it right now.
But if I were to quickly go into here and select the text and in character, set it to White.
It will come back here.
Give it a second to update.
And there it is.
So what does that mean?
Well, if I turn it back to Black Control and Z and I bring back this bottom layer.
This will now run a lot quicker.
That was still showing weight because it takes a little bit to to date.
But if I now go in and out here, rather than having to pre render like the whole video, which even
the HD with tracking on it would take a while, you saw how quickly that thing came through.
And as we wait, there's Jimmy Bland and he's there.
So bear that in mind, because the only thing we need really on here is the graphics that are on top
of the video.
We don't need to bring the video back in.
And that's the beauty of also duplicating, because then we don't have to have the after effects file
that has been brought in, which, as you can see, has been brought into here.
It always makes a mess, but it's been brought into here.
But we don't need the video because we already have the original underneath here.
And that can really help if you've got a slower machine or if you just want to run your machine as efficiently
as possible.
So with that now done.
What more can I do?
Well, the thing is, there's a lot more that's just been on this video again.
So we've got it as a reference.
And there's so much more we can do.
And to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce my good friend, and that is not there.
It's here.
Oh, normally it's an extensions, but they must have used a different coding.
Now we're going to animation.
COMPOSER three And I'm going to duck it just here.
Remember to duck things.
You just grab it and look where it offers to go to.
I have mine living here again when I'm full screen.
I'm all the way over here.
You can't even see that.
But yeah, when I'm here, it's here.
And what is this?
Well, it's my dear friends at Mr. Horse.
This is the after effects version of premiere composer.
And it's even more powerful, but it's going to be essential typography.
And I want to go to I want to do a call out and I think that's with the lines text in line, call outs.
And this is the kind of thing that we have here.
We also have them in a in premiere.
See that all good.
However, in here with this we can absolutely nail it and go crazy with the tracking.
Let me just load these up and show you what they are.
So here we go.
We've got them all loading up.
Good.
So we're going to say he's Jimmy Bland and I want two lines.
So let me go with this one.
First, let me just.
Tilda, back out.
Tilda, by the way, as you've probably noticed, works in this as well.
So there's a call out and I kind of want it to go.
Yeah.
You know, it will go.
We'll go with this one.
Top, left, top, it's called.
So I'm going to add this before we do anything which is going to sort out the wording at all.
But first of all, let's get rid of Jimmy Bland there.
Don't need that anymore.
And in here, this is how it looks.
So we've got Mrs. Haws always brings in things that I want to.
Two lines.
Did I select the wrong one?
Maybe I did want this one, so I'm going to replace here.
This highlighted this gives a great option to just replace.
I'm just going to replace there and cool.
So we're now working on one with two lines.
So I'm going to say this is Jimmy Plant.
And we're going to say 0080, we're going to say Agent 008.
He's just like James Bond, but his jokes are really bad, hence blunt.
And I'm going to set that text to black.
America is also going to set this text to black.
And we're going to go with this color line, see all the different things we can change.
We're going to go maybe like a steel blue.
D'arrigo.
Jimmy Bland In fact, maybe I'm going to set that to White.
I might look maybe like an off-white.
But I like that.
Yeah.
I'm going to drop a drop shadow on there as well.
So I'm going to call a pack and just go with that cry as well.
Good.
That's definitely not the right place, is it?
No.
However, it can go in any place we want and then we can track from the same bit.
Remember, all our information is in the know.
Okay, so let's place this where we want it.
So again, let's get to a point in the video where we want to have it.
And this is something that you will see a lot with regards to aftereffects when you're moving around.
Everything starts to go up to here pixelated and all that.
If you look up here as you scroll up, you'll see adaptive resolution.
There are different ways in which you can have this, but I just prefer adaptive resolution.
Okay, so what do I want to do?
Well, first and foremost, let's place the text where we want to place it.
And this is all the way.
Oh, yeah, we're in after effects, so we don't need to because in here if we play keyboard, we have
position.
So just like in the effects controls, you've got position there.
Here we have effects controls here.
Or you can just grab it and drag it and we're just going to place that there.
Okay.
Now I'm going to get a drop shadow on this now just so it's there because I can't quite see this, but
I do want to keep the grey might change that color anyway.
We go to get a colour to get a drop shadow just like in effects.
Here we've got effects and then we've got presets.
It's exactly the same effects and presets.
Click here.
All we do is type in drop shadow that is right at the bottom and we track that onto the comp that we
want to effect boom as our drop shadow.
Okay.
And when I turn up the opacity all the way to 100, you know me, that's what I like.
I'm going to set the softness to try five and see if that's good for us.
Yeah, okay, that's good.
But now that text is black and black.
Okay, so the second colour text can change that to white.
The only annoyance is, is that it applies a drop shadow to the line as well.
And until, until they change that and allow us to drop properties on here within animation composer.
That's what we have, but that's fine.
So that's where I want the text.
So we now need to move the call out line.
And to do that we need to go for the colour point and set the you can't drag this because it's a particular
bit.
So we just start to drag the numbers and as you can see.
When I let go, it starts to bring this line down.
I saw it because it was being in the bounding box of the actual prick up, down.
So I bring it down a little bit more.
And of course we're tracking to here, but we don't have to link to here.
It's just a fact that positions well, I'm just going to go back a little bit to to to his head.
Maybe not.
Maybe do it to actually where?
Around about where we've tracked.
Bring that down a little bit more.
I may be over to that and now we just pre render it.
How do we pre render in after effects?
Well, it's not shift enter anywhere in here.
You just hit zero on the number pad and this starts playing through and this screen starts coming up.
Good.
Good.
What's wrong?
Hmm.
We haven't got it to track.
Grab the pick, whip.
Let's get to a pit where we're happy with.
Good.
Grab the pick up and drag it onto the No.
Nothing changes because at that point we want it there.
However, we come back and hit zero again.
How good is that?
I can see that that kind of is just thing on his bicep and I don't really like that.
So I am actually going to move the call up point a bit closer to him.
And because it's not this that's tracking the the information wasn't put on the original text, we can
put it onto here because we just using the null, the null is creating all the things.
That's Jimmy Bland.
The beauty of this also is that we can actually set the endpoint to become a little bit longer, take
a little bit longer to come on, because that's our endpoint.
So it's stuttering a little bit because it's not being pre-rendered by any sites.
It's dealing with it.
Okay.
That's Jimmy Bland preset actions.
We could also get this to animate out, I'm pretty sure, because what we didn't do is we didn't have
animate out text.
So that's still this one.
Yeah, it was.
And I'm going to animate out and something that I have to replace.
That's a bit annoying, isn't it?
But it's okay because it keeps all the information, because we've told it what to replace.
It's kept everything.
It does not keep absolutely everything, but it has.
In this case.
It's even kept the the drop shadow.
So playing that through.
Various.
That's Jimmy Plant also.
With regards to this, if you want it then to move this around and you thought actually it'd be better
down here at the bottom left.
Let's just do it.
We're moving the call out tighter.
So if we hit P on the keyboard, we can easily drag this down, maybe drag it over to the left.
A hold on the call up points there now.
You know what we're going to do, don't you?
Which one do we want?
Make that one.
Yeah.
Replace.
I just boom, boom, boom.
And okay, it does reset the in and out, but it still got that position.
And if we bring him now, get to a position again on the keyboard and bring that up and we move that
call up point.
Drag it up a bit.
Maybe drag it over to the side.
See, this is the beauty of using Premier Horse or Mr. Horse animation composer, because again, I've
already seen that's not the right one, is it?
So it's actually that one that we need.
And if if we'd not if we just dragged it in and didn't replace, we'd have had to do all that formatting
again.
So I think we finally got it now, don't you?
And I just want us to.
On purpose, to.
To practice.
He lies through his teeth.
Okay, so you want that a little bit higher?
I'm going to bring this call up point just a little bit over here.
All right.
Update I got to move a little bit further over here and let's see how that does.
Obviously, we're tracking at this point, this side of the body is going to move differently.
Is it going to look natural enough?
The mini zero, by the way, the play head goes back to the beginning and starts playing, although
the play head shows there.
That works well.
Brilliant.
Like the zoo, the animation out to be a little bit slower.
Yeah.
Looks good, doesn't it?
And then we just get it out.
Don't forget to make sure it's less labor intensive for Premiere Pro.
We.
Get away the video.
Don't need it.
That's working on in the background.
We can actually see that now control s come out and now if we want to double check that it's fully come
in, just turn that off.
And yeah, that's all that's going if we select the button turn that off yet the whole thing goes pre
render that and although again it's a motion graphics it's going in there that's quite big from Mr.
Horse, from the animation composer, but it works perfectly.
And that fellow right there is who is he?
Do you know who he is?
Oh, yeah, he's Jimmy Bland, Agent Double-O, eight.
And that is how to track text in after effects or in Premiere Pro.
That wasn't too bad, was it?
No, I know it wasn't.
You're absolutely fine.
You got from Premiere Pro to After Effects.
I'm right back again.
And nothing bad happened, did it?
So what we're going to do next is I'm going to show you more ways to use after effects with the tracking
ability in it to create some great, great effects and just, oh, honestly, this will level up your
game even more.


### 11. Lock-On Effect

This is the lock on effect.
You may have seen it in a number of commercials.
Dre Beats being one that has been used a lot, but it's a really I love this effect and this is how
it looks.
Now, believe it or not, there was no camera movement or very little camera movement in this actual
original footage.
But what this does is it locks on to a certain point in your frame and moves everything else around
it.
And in this chapter, we're going to find out how to do it in just really a couple of clicks.
However, there are some things to learn here, too.
So, yeah, get yourself a coffee or a drink, whatever beverage of choice you have.
And let's get in to the lock on effect.
So how do we get this effect?
Well, it's a really well used, the fact it's not used that often.
You may have seen it in like the Beats commercial and it's when used, when done properly, it's a great
effect.
So I've got the footage from Motion, right?
Machinery isn't the only source for stock footage that I use, and I will be covering another one that
I absolutely love.
And it gives you more options in the future.
But for a quick, quick clip, this is perfect.
So I've selected this clip, which is woman on a treadmill, just inspiring labeling.
But it tells you what you need.
So we're going to start a new sequence.
We haven't done one of these for a bit.
So just to cover this as well.
I've gone into my bean.
You don't have to do this, but I do like to try and keep it as clean and tidy as possible.
But as you can see, these things kind of get away from us.
So I'm going to go into my bean sequences control and and I'm going to call this lock on effect.
I have my custom sequence of 1080, 25 amps and hit okay crack.
And so that's the start.
And then going to what is that 60.
This is a six track.
So for these purposes, I might actually accept that and explain why.
But let me get I've taken the liberty of downloading already.
And this now says the clip does not match the sequences.
Settings change sequence to match the clip settings in this in this kind of in this time, I'm going
to say yes.
And that's because I want all of those 60 frames a second and I'll show you why.
So they change sequence settings and it's going to obey those.
Okay.
So here is our clip and just going to let it go to drag for until her full face is in shot.
Let's talk about that.
And yeah, okay, let's just drag it to the end.
I just by the way, I queue on the keyboard to trend the beginning and I don't necessarily need all
of this.
Let's just get it until she looks down.
One.
Look up.
That's enough to show this.
So I'm going to hit you on the keyboard to trim everything at the end.
Okay.
So what do we do now?
Well, we take it into after effects, but before we do that, just make sure that your after effects
composition is open if your after effects project is open.
That is, if you're working in a pre-existing project.
Because if not, when you right click and open after effects within Premiere Pro, it will try and open
a new one, which is fine, but if you want to work an existing one.
So we're in this one, which is the one we've been working in before.
Remember that we tracked it will try to open a new one.
And when you select this one, so say premiere pro animations, select this one, it would try and overwrite
it and we don't want that way to easily get round the is purely just to have the project open that you
want to work in.
So going back, remember we hold out and drag up and let go and we duplicate it.
So we're affecting the new track, not the one below.
Just so we're not, we we don't have to go back if everything if anything goes wrong or we decide we
don't want this, we can just delete this top bit and we still have the original at the bottom.
It's no biggie with, you know, just a single clip and a sequence.
But if you had a massive sequence, loads of things and you made that decision, it's not too easy to
rectify it.
So best practice.
If you're doing anything after effects, just duplicate it.
And don't forget, I mean, just remember in this one, we don't even have any of the video on this
track.
We just have the graphics.
And if we just to make it easier for Premiere Pro and if we didn't have that, we wouldn't have anything.
So that makes sense.
I think so.
So we're going to go into here and right click our top clip and replace with after effects composition.
What this does as you've seen it before, it drags it into here or exports it into after effects, creates
a new composition here and places our footage in there.
Now, why did I say yes to allowing for new settings in here?
Well, that's because I wanted to use all of those 60 frames, because if we scroll along here now and
if you look, there's very little motion blur.
There's a little bit is a little bit in a hands.
Yeah there.
So if you look at a hands a hands are blurred there and that all comes down to shutter speed.
So if we're talking shutter speed and 180 degree rule, so the hundred 80 degree rule is shooting double
your frame rate.
So say this was shot at 30 frames a second, which I'm kind of thinking it might have been because we've
got motion blur.
So if it was shot at 60 frames per second, which is what this is, I'm assuming that the videographer,
whoever's behind the camera, has set his camera or her camera to 120, 120th of a second.
What that does is that anything faster than that and you won't get this blur, which is kind of what
we want, but to make things more natural, you kind of want a bit of motion blur.
You see, when one hand is kind of in the same area for more than a couple of frames, it stabilizes
and we get a clean shot.
As she starts to move again, it goes blurred.
So if you're ever shooting your own footage that you want to be able to to track cleanly and easily,
I'm not anticipating too many problems because I've seen already where we're going to track.
But if you want it as clean as possible, I take that shutter speed right the way up.
Obviously more shoot a high shutter speed, you get less lighting.
So you might have to compensate with ISO or a wider aperture, but it will give you a cleaner for a
cleaner footage to be able to track from.
But again, I don't think we're going to have a problem here.
So let's let me just check if right at the beginning, we've got then we've probably got enough on that
frame to track.
But I'm going to move here.
So we're going to start tracking from right in the beginning.
And where I'm looking is on her notes.
And the reason why I said I think we've got an okay place to track is because if I zoom in by scrolling
up and hold down the spacebar and drag down just to change our viewing, it doesn't move around the
track, it just move around the clip.
It just moves around the within the actual display.
And if I look here, I'm going to be tracking her nose because we have shadow in here, which is what
we're looking for.
We look of a contrast, but most importantly, we've got different skin tones around here.
And then we've got black or pretty much all black, which gives us that contrasting colours, contrast
contrasting colours.
And that means that anything to the right of her nose as we're tracking through the tracking software,
will automatically, automatically go.
No, that's not what we're trying to track.
And if we track something as close as we can to this black, that will keep us in line.
What would be lovely is if she had a beauty spot or a mole because it would show up really dark against
her, like the skin tone.
And we could just track that, which is always really handy if you've ever seen the ad, the Dre Beats
advert where it has very similar to this.
They will track right on that earphone, not just because that's the product that they're trying to
sell, but also whoever was wearing it, it was contrasted massively against their skin tones.
But yeah, we we will track with what we can so we can track her nose and whoever this whoever this
model is.
Apologies.
We're going to get, like, really close to your nose.
It's a lovely nose, so I don't know why I'm apologising.
So we could track motion, but that's not what we're going to do here, because the lock on effect is
a version of stabilisation, but it's not warp stabilizer, which we actually haven't covered yet.
And it's the main stabilizer for footage.
We'll we'll cover that in a in another chapter, but we're going to use stabilised motion.
So with our track selected, we're going to click this and watch what happens.
We go like way in.
If I zoom out, you can see how similar track point is.
So it's placed our track point there and it's pretty much in the centre.
So what do we do?
Okay, well we need to move this, so we need to zoom in a little bit so we can actually see.
And then I'm going to grab somewhere.
Where I'm looking to grab is somewhere in this in a box but not the the cross.
Okay.
So now stop moving and drag up here a little bit and look too far.
We're going to track here, okay?
Let go.
So we're kind of in this space that's not exactly where we're going to track.
However, I see this this cross when you start dragging.
I know we've covered this before, but just to just to kind of doubly explain this, we turn into a
kind of magnification and the cross turns to an X.
You see that if I let go, it goes back to a cross.
But once I start dragging, it goes to an X.
I never notice that until I start to really pay attention to this, to teach you guys what I'm going
to do.
So I'm aiming for this area here right towards the end of the nose.
I don't know.
I don't really get the tip, the nose, because if we look here, it's pretty much the same skin tone,
although a few highlights all the way around the edge of a nose.
So I'm trying to give the the tracking engine a little bit of contrast at least.
So we're going to track right at the end of her nose.
And then what we're going to do is we want to this will slow down.
This will slow down the tracking process, but it will give us a cleaner and more accurate track.
So I'm going to open up this bounding box all the way to kind of cover most of her nose.
Then I'm going to open up this bounding box.
So just to reiterate what these do.
This sets the band in box.
I want to track within here and more specifically on a track that cross this bounding box is saying
is between frames or maybe multiple frames.
Keep an eye on this area because what we're trying to track may venture into those areas.
Okay.
Well, there's no time like the present.
We need to just start tracking and see if this is correct.
So we first go to our options and remember, I always have it to stop tracking.
The default is adapt feature.
I don't see why you would want to adopt feature because that that says if the confidence is below a
certain point and we think that we're losing our track, we're just going to kind of make it up as we
go along and do our best guess.
It's kind of not what we want for this effect, and I can't think of an effects that you would want
this.
But anyway, I've got to stop tracking.
So if anything goes wrong or it thinks, Oh, I've lost it, it will just stop and I can decide what
I need to do about it.
The default confidence is 80%, so that means if it's anything less than 80% sure that's what we want
to track, it will stop tracking.
Okay.
Depending on how accurate you want your track, you could take this higher to almost like 90% or 100%.
You'd be there all day.
But I'm going to leave that 80% and see where we get with that.
So if I click okay and now is the moment of truth, so we zoom out a little bit so I can just one click
just so I can see everything.
And because we're in the center, pretty much the center of the track, I'm going to analyze backwards
first.
So this is by frame and this is just to press play but in reverse.
So let's see how we get on.
So I'm going to analyze backwards now again, this is going to take a bit of time.
As you can see, it's going frame by frame, but it seems to be keeping up quite well with her notes.
This says that if you start something and it starts, it stops straight away, it could literally be
the bounding boxes that have to be just tweaked a little bit.
So don't just give up hope, just play with it a little bit and see where we're at.
And that has not stopped tracking and it's done it all the way.
Brilliant.
Now we want to track forward of this position.
And now we could drag nothing's been set in stone, by the way.
We just have the information now.
We could just drag until we see stop in tracking and then move back a bit, see how a nose is moving
on its own.
Also, if you look here as I drag forward, these little bits start to disappear.
And that's so it only keeps up to a certain amount and it's just so by the end of your footage, depending
on how long as you're not, you can't.
If there's a lot of movement and there's a lot of footage before long, you can imagine, this whole
frame is just take it up by key points.
So I'm going to drag this back a little bit, but I'm not I'm going to do use a little shortcut, and
that shortcut is you on the keyboard.
And what this does is if I've got the clip selected, which already has these SEP track points, which
are also keyframes, and this is what the shortcut does.
We want to reveal key frames.
So to do that we have the clip selected and by default and I've never changed this, I just remember
it you press you on the keyboard and all of a sudden we've brought up all of our key frames.
And what we can see here is that we have feature center confidence and a touch point.
We don't really care about that.
We just see the fact that we've got loads and loads.
If I zoom in loads of key frames here, why have I brought up this?
Well, remember in Premiere Pro, remember this?
Image.
Or these buttons.
Well, you can see that we can set a keyframe.
We can go to a next keyframe, but we can't because there's no key frames to the right to it.
But we can go back to the to the previous keyframe.
And if I click that once, that's where we started.
So now we can track forward from here, knowing that when we get to the end of here, every single frame
will have been tracked.
Good.
Okay, let's track forward.
Let's see how well it did.
Brilliant.
Going back.
Let's see how it does going forward, because I know there is a little bit of camera movement.
Okay.
Still seems to be doing good.
I promise you, if my these boxes were slightly different, too small or too big, this track would
not be anywhere near as accurate as this is.
So I can't I can't push this enough.
You need to just make sure that your boxes are the right size for what you're trying to track.
And if in whatever footage you've got, it's just crashing or stopping.
Just go right, right to the back and just set your track points on a promise here.
Nine times out of ten that fixes it on the on occasion that it doesn't work as well, that the footage
is garbage and it can't be tracked.
But we live in that.
So we now have a successfully tracked piece of footage.
What do we do now?
Well, within here, we don't go anywhere until we apply this stabilization.
Okay.
So we're going to hit, apply, and it brings up applied dimensions X and Y.
The options are exactly or why only we don't.
We want X and Y.
So X is going side by side.
Y is up and down.
If you only want to track the movement of going left and right, you'd say X only.
Similarly, if you only wanted to track the up and down movement you select y we want both selected.
Okay.
And now it's brought us out of that inner bit and.
We now have our footage stabilized.
So let me just get a fit.
And let's play it back and see what we've got.
So already you can see the start of this effect.
You see it.
It's looking good.
But now we need to absolutely nail this lockout effect.
And what you've probably noticed is around here, we've got black this is actually quite a dark scene.
So I'm actually going to put a white solid behind them like a climate in in premiere pro well in after
effects is called solid.
I know we've done one of these before because it names the color.
Love that.
I'm just going to drag that the low.
So it really highlights what we're looking at.
So we'll take that right at the beginning and play that through again.
As you can see, now that we've got white behind it, there's a lot of movement there, but her head
is completely still.
Now, I can already foresee that we might have a little bit of problems with regards to how close this
is coming to the top of her head.
But let's see what we can do.
So let's get somewhere where I think it's the most drastic.
Um, I'd say maybe about there.
Okay, so we're going to have this, and we're going to have we're going to use this as our kind of
like setting for where we're going to set this video and to move this.
Now we select our clip and we twirl up and then twirl back down and it gives us everything.
And then we 12 down to look at our transform.
There's an easy way to do that.
Let me close up again and I'm going to hit on the keyboard for position boom.
We have our position.
I also want to show the scale.
So I hit s on the keyboard but position goes away.
Well we can show them both at the same time.
How?
Well, just like in any other software where you hold down, shift and select multiple things, well,
we just select that and we've got scale that.
So if I hold shift and press P, we now have position in scale right there.
So we don't have all of this to deal with.
I mean, if we had everything open and you can imagine the different kind of effects, it all comes
down here and it gets really busy really quickly.
So close that up remembering that you don't hold shift until the second thing that you want to show.
If I hold down shift and press P doesn't show anything, that's because it's not to show it as as well
as anything else.
So we hit P on the keyboard for first and then hit shift and S and we have both position and scale top
tip.
Okay, so let's scale this up.
And now we're going to and that's just with the scale there.
And we can either use this position or we can just drag it because it's selected.
I've brought a position here not only to show you, but also so we can do some fine tuning.
And I want to have that.
Let's just turn on our title action Safe Grid.
And okay, I think I'm as close as I can kind of get, really.
I'd like a further down, but the way that's been shot, there's not that much headroom above her.
Again, if you if you're shooting this and this is your footage, you don't really want your talent
that close to the top of the actual of off the frame.
I mean, it's fine when she's down here, but as she goes up, she's really close to the top of the
frame.
You want to give them what's called headroom.
It kind of does what it says in the tent.
So if I've got that, I kind of want to I'm going to move her over a little bit just so her ear is in
line with the center.
Good.
And let's see how that looks.
So I'm going to go home and press take off those action and press play.
Got no headroom coming in.
Alex.
Good.
Well, there you go.
There's that lock on effect, although.
How good is that?
So how we.
How do we get this back into Premier Pro?
Well, we just control s go back into premier.
And now this will be updated.
It's not updated just yet.
There we go.
Well updated.
And just to absolutely nail this on, we in and out and I always pre render I'm just I'm just one of
those I I had laser surgery done many years ago and it's purely because I want everything in absolutely
perfect focus all the time.
And I'm no different with my video editing.
So taking that back and.
Yeah, it's good.
And the beauty of this is I can actually show you now because these are two separate.
If I disable this for a second, she's back there.
I can just maybe shorten this a bit and play them both.
That's pretty round.
It doesn't take that long.
And if that's the original, which looks great, and if that's the effect you're going for, great.
But if you want a lock on effect.
Right there.
And that is how to get the lock on effect nice and easily.
In just a few steps.


### 12. Remove Objects in Videos

So we're going to use this fact on a number of clips to show you the different ways and the different
things you may need to be looking out for.
But first and foremost, to explain exactly what is happening, I need to take you to another Adobe
product and that is Photoshop.
So I'm just going to export a frame out of here.
So to do that, remember, we get to a place in our timeline where we want just clear that in and out
because it really I have this problem and we press C on the keyboard or we hit this to take A to export
frame press C and we're just going to say, which can I call that peach?
I'm not going to import into the project because I don't need to.
And I'll see you in Photoshop.
I promise this is not going to be a Photoshop tutorial.
I just want to show you what we're going to be using because the tool that we use started life in Photoshop.
So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be removing this woman here from the beach.
Maybe she didn't know that she was in it.
Or maybe it's something from your own footage using actually that distracts.
And I want just, you know, footage of here well in an image be quite easy.
What we do is we maybe grabbing a lips tool.
And you draw that ellipse around your subject and you just go to image and you go to edit.
I have a shortcut.
Contents where I fell and that's what we want.
We hit.
Okay.
I think that's right and let's you then a couple of clicks.
She's come now that effect that engine as it were I used the term engine a lot, but that engine is
called Sensata.
It is now in Photoshop.
However, that ability in Photoshop has been around for a good number of years.
However, it's only just probably quite recently actually made in the last 18 months to two years.
It's coming to video editing, and the reason why it's taken so long is because this is just one frame.
There are 25 frames in every second here.
So we need something that's going to be able to get all of them out.
Can you guess what it is yet?
Yes, it's after effects.
And I just need to take this second to to qualify this.
I know this is a course about Premiere Pro.
However, if you were just using Final Cut, which is Apple's Apple's editing program, you would only
have final cuts and you would only be able to edit video and the little things that you're able to do
in that.
The beauty of Premiere Pro and maybe probably the reason why you've selected this program over all the
analysis non-linear editors is the fact that we have all this ability, not just within Premiere Pro,
but being able to outsource.
And I think one of the main strengths of Premiere Pro is that ability, which is why I am so, so heavily
on after effects.
When you get to a certain level, when you get so advanced that you're like, Right, what else can
I do?
And that's why I'm covering After Effects quite a bit now.
So what do we do?
Well, we know we duplicate that we're just going to stay in lock on effect.
Do you know what?
No, we're not.
We are not.
We're going to do things correctly because that's what you need to do.
And I don't want it all a case of do what I say, not as I do.
So we're going to start a new sequence, which is control.
And on the keyboard we have our custom 1080 by 1080 video 25 FP And I'm going to select this as removal
because we're going to do a couple in here and hit enter and that is our new sequence.
Go back into motion.
Right.
And let me just check on my downloads.
It's called We're going to do a car as well, and I'm going to show you something really, just really
interesting with regards to this and how you can really get a really good effect.
And it's because we duplicate in here.
Anyway, before we get to that, I've got two things as well.
It's all drone footage, actually, but this can be used in any footage.
Woman walking on beach.
So there we are.
She was already open for us.
There we are.
Boom.
Done.
Keep existing settings.
Close that for now and.
Okay, we're here.
Okay.
So we're just going to duplicate that and we're going to go straight into aftereffects.
I don't do anything else.
Obviously, you could trim that depending on how long or how short you want it.
But let's just have a quick scrub through.
And she's in there all the way through.
Good.
Okay, so what do we do?
Well, first and foremost, we need to tell the software where we want to or what we want to remove.
So this is the furthest she is away.
This is the closest she is.
I'm actually going to start from the closest.
It probably doesn't matter.
But if you've got something that's out of frame, say she's out of frame here or went down there, there's
no point trying to track her.
Once she comes into frame.
So you track her when she's all the way in frame to try to do that.
The reason why I'm doing this is just because I want to give it as much information as possible possible.
And then we're going to track the mask backwards as it goes, as it as it decreases in size.
It's just it just gives it a little bit more of a chance.
So how do we do this?
Okay.
Well, we come up, we can do it.
We can select a number of tools.
We can either use a rectangle round a rectangle, all of these, or we can use.
If I can get that off, we can use the pen tool and I'm going to use the pen tool for this.
Okay.
Now, how do I explain this?
You know, let's let's let's draw this and then we'll see.
Okay.
So I'm zooming in so I can get to her and I hold down the spacebar to get her fully in shut.
And that is the person we want to remove.
But we don't just want to remove her.
We also want to remove the shadow.
If we just removed her and have the shadow moving along, it would be like a ghost walking along.
And that's not what we want.
Okay, so let's start as we mean to go on and I'm going to start maybe just somewhere down here.
You don't get too close.
Just give a bit of breathing room, as it were, and we just start drawing with the pen tool with the
clip selected.
Okay, so let's just click around.
Just you don't you can be as as accurate or as inaccurate as you like.
And obviously, don't forget, you can do this with the pen tool.
And don't forget that game that I linked.
I mentioned previous and there's a link to that in your worksheet along with anywhere, but I used to
get stock footage and plugins.
This stock footage is once again from motion, right?
Okay.
So we get towards the end of this mass, we've got all the way around her shadow and we'll complete
the mass by clicking here.
That's not what we want.
We've removed everything except what we want to remove.
How do we sort that out?
Okay, so if we come down to here now and remember how we pressed P for position as for scale, it also
have t for opacity while m is mask.
You don't miss this.
I mean, it's easy to remember that because it's m for mask, but you don't necessarily need to remember
that because you can pull it down.
And here it is, mask.
So what we want to do is this mask here it's currently on ADD, which means that it keeps everything
in the mask and removes everything outside to invert that does the opposite, but the inversion opposite
subtract.
Right now we just want to select it as none.
So we still have the mask, but the mask is doing nothing.
So understood.
Okay, let me just zoom back out to fit and you can see how small she is in comparison.
But remember, we're right at the end as well, so she gets even smaller.
So the first step, I'm just going to go back to my selection tool rather than my pen tool and going
to come down to this mask.
And the reason why we've opened this is because we want to track the mask.
Now, this used to take ages and they used to be used as a deep dive into so many settings to do this.
But right now it's just as easy as right clicking mask and track mask.
Now the tracker opens up.
Okay, so what do you want to track?
Well, let's just have a look.
Definitely the position.
Definitely the scale because she gets bigger.
In the frame.
Don't necessarily think we want to to mask rotation.
Although I'm going to leave it on.
Let's see what it does.
We remember these buttons.
We can analyze by one frame or analyze by all of it.
This is tracking backwards.
This is tracking forward.
Analyzing forward by one frame.
So with this, because we're at the end, we're going to track backwards.
Now, this can take some time depending on the speed of your computer.
Also the footage as well that the size and quality of the footage.
So we're just going to track back and let's see how long this takes us.
Okay.
So that took about 4 minutes in total.
And then the way in which you can tell it's done is that we have all these key frames.
So if we just I'm just going to zoom in a bit just to check if I'm happy with the mask.
And okay.
The mask has drifted slightly.
Let's see if it's all that way.
Maybe it is.
Okay.
So what we need to do is we need to make it just a little bit bigger.
So if we grab a pencil and track this.
If I if I select the mask, if I come in here and try and move one of these points, it moves everything.
And the reason why I know it's moving everything is because everything's selected.
And the reason why no, everything selected is because everything is a solid square.
So if I come down here and hold down shift and click one, this one is now selected.
And as I move away, all of these now go to hollow boxes.
So I'm just going to move this all out just a little bit further.
I did say could be as accurate as you want.
I got to be honest, I was trying to be really clean when I was doing this.
I've never been as clean as what I did before.
And in all honesty, it kind of bit me in the backside.
So I'm just going to move all this out just a little bit more, give it a bit more room.
And I'm actually going to and you can do this really quite easily.
I'm leaving this in.
I would you would you could think why haven't I just taken this out and we recorded it?
I want to show you what can happen.
I want to use this opportunity as a way of showing you what can happen when you're too accurate.
So what am I going to do now?
Well, I'm going to select all of these key frames by just dragging all the way over.
I've missed one, but I will get that.
And while they're selected, I'm just going to delete.
Okay, I'm then going to delete that and that's now move my mask.
But that's okay because if I select my mask with my selection tool, click off, then I click that mask
again.
It's all selected again.
So all I have to do is just drag this back into the position that I was in.
Actually, that's not even correct, is it?
Hmm.
Of course the end may be.
You know, I'm still going to leave this on because I'm going to show you what you need to do if you
ruin that.
Okay.
We're going to get rid of this mask.
So delete that mask by selecting and deleting, and then I'm going to draw this mask again.
Okay.
So let's be a little bit more generous at this point.
So let's click all the way around.
I'm just going to be as rough as anything.
Give loads of room for this.
And close it up.
And again, we're here now.
We've got a different color, by the way, you may have noticed by now, brown and green.
It's kind of a thing in after effects as you as you change.
If as you start a new mask, it always changes the colors.
And I'll show you why why they do that or how many times that happens in a future section.
If you want to skip ahead and look at that, it will be the right on effect.
And it's something that I've used for a number of years now and I've never seen a decent enough tutorial
about it anywhere.
So you're going to get that off me.
So anyway, we've got this mask.
Remember, we go down to the mask and we select none.
We're right at the end and we're just going to track this again and see how it goes this time.
Okay.
So that seems to have tracked much better if we just track this through.
Yeah, she's covered.
She's coverage is covered.
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.
That's good.
That's good.
Okay, cracking.
So we've got something to work with now.
So where were we at before?
Okay, well, what it had, it was at by default.
Okay.
So we then went to none and tracked it.
But now we want to get rid of this.
So we're going to select, subtract and then we are done.
Now, depending on what's toggled on and off with your version of After Effects, you could have the
Alpha Channel behind here.
I had it turned off for projects by going to leave it on now so you can really see that that's what's
missing.
Let me just go back to fit and good.
I'm happy with that.
And as we drag through.
Notice that we haven't had to apply anything.
Last time we did the tracker, once it tracks, we've applied this.
Is this all this tracker information is saved down here.
If it's well, this down, it's all saved in this mask path.
And there we are all the way through and we're laughing.
So then we use remember in Photoshop, we used content to wear fell.
So if I don't do that and we went to image no we didn't content over fill and delete at that select
at that and press okay.
And it got rid of how well we're going to do that here as well.
So we're going to go to content to where fell.
As you can see here, I'm just going to go back to my selection tool if you don't see it here to go
to window and select content to where.
And we open this up and as you can see right here, is that going to show if I tell you?
Not really.
As you can see here, there's a very small little blob.
And that little blob with a pink outline is this mask right here.
So we're going to use content to our field to fill in the gap that this subtraction of the mask has
created.
So by default, I put it on about it's normally I think it's zero is our expansion and scope is three.
Once again, this gives us just a little bit more room around.
We're going to say the fill method is objects, but it could be surface or edge blend objects, as always
works perfectly for me.
We don't necessarily need to correct that for lighting.
Obviously, if you're doing something in the Oh, that's not quite right.
It's not come out too good.
You can always play with these.
My range is the work area.
Remember, we set this on a previous thing.
This could be the work area.
We can do the whole of it and that's it.
We're just going to generate the fill there.
Again, this takes a bit of time, so let's see.
As you can see, this is not running all the way through.
This is real time at the moment, so it's not taking too long.
I'll come back when this has completed.
And so we've finished now generating the fill.
And if I click out and play.
She is absolutely.
Completely.
Vanished.
I mean, it's almost magic, isn't it?
Let me control and save that.
Let's come back to Premiere Pro.
There she has the update.
Then she's got.
Maybe not.
Now she's gone.
This uses Adobe Dynamic Link, so it can actually, you know, take a couple of seconds.
But if I drag that up and say, put a crossfade on there.
So there's the original below and there's what we've done in After Effects.
I just want a fader out as she goes and she's disappeared.
That's the beauty of having the two versions as well, because then you can play around with it and
in the next one we're going to play around with it.
So here's some more footage that I've got from I Have Motion, right?
And this is a car just driving on a lovely open road.
And while I would love to be whoever's driving that car, what we're going to do is we're going to get
rid of it.
I believe in the power of repetition.
So in this one, which is going to do exactly the same as what we did before, purely because it looks
like we're going to get a decent mascot of this.
So.
And we go.
And that's actually taking up more screen.
So I'll show you everything.
There we go.
And okay, so what do we do?
Well, we know exactly what we do, so we highlight the clip.
So down here, we've got our pencil selected, and we come down.
And don't forget the shadow.
We come out and we draw a mask, bearing in mind that we give it room to go.
In fact, let's undo some of those.
But I don't think I'm coming out wide enough and come along here.
And what they should do, because I've gone all the way along here, let me just set that.
Remember, highlight em for mask and none, because I've got this along here and there's actually a
line of off of grass or whatever that is that gives this contrast.
So hopefully what sensei to again that's what's after effects is using in this with the Adobe sensei.
Hopefully that will recognise that and see.
Okay, we don't want to go the other side of that.
How do we do it.
We come down to mask again.
If it's not showing, for whatever reason you've come out and you've come back in press m on your keyboard
mask, right click and track mask that then opens here.
Now, do we want rotation?
Yeah, maybe.
I think we do.
You can't have scale with that rotation.
And although I don't really think the scale changes because I think it stays all the way through, we
do probably need rotation, we probably do need scale.
So we're going to have to go up position, scale, rotation.
Good.
So let's track this.
I'm just going to zoom out a little bit so I can keep an eye and hit on aligns forward often on us play
but over here.
Okay.
I'm just going to pause here because I can see that the mask has drifted slightly because of the shadows
on the track back.
I was quite a while.
Maybe that wasn't it.
So don't forget, we can we can move this.
What I want to do is I'm actually going to delete all the key keyframes up until this point.
Delete.
I think there's one more.
So I'm just going to zoom in that.
Delete that.
And with my my pencil hold down shift, I'm going to select the mask that would help hold down shift
and just deselect all of those.
I'm just going to move this out ever so slightly.
So grab that box there, maybe give that a bit more headroom.
And that's not great when it's yellow.
Okay.
And that up a little bit.
Okay.
That's a little bit better.
Carry on trucking forward.
That's why it's it's quite important to keep an eye on this.
You would love to just go away.
But yeah, kind of need to keep an eye on the tracking.
That's Kyle.
It's going to pause this again because this looks very, very close.
Oh, I'll go back to there and select my mask.
It's really quite close to the front of the car.
Now, we can we can avoid certain things like this with regards to the the alpha expansion.
When we do that in the contents whereby I'm just going to give it a little bit of a fighting chance,
just carry on there.
And again, I can see that where we're starting to lose that track a little bit to see where the shadow
is, it's going to take it back a little bit.
Just to there.
I'm going to move it out even further.
We don't have to delete these.
We can just hit, analyze, vulnerable, overwrite these key frames.
This is getting quite far away from the back as well.
So we can start moving these in a bit.
You don't normally have to do this, but maybe just with this footage thing is it's trial and error
and it all depends.
It's it's dependent on the footage that you're using.
But let's check that forward, see if that continues now.
Okay.
So we got that.
It took a while, took a little bit of jiggery pokery.
But yeah, we looked like we got there.
So if I scrub back and forth it's quite large footage show it's it did really struggle at that but okay
let's apply the same and let's see what it does.
So we're going to go to our mask and we're going to again go to subtract.
So it creates this whole space, right?
That whole space thing.
And then we're going to come to content to where film.
Now, we did see that there was times where the mask was really quite close and we don't want that.
So I'm going to actually take this off expansion and take it to five.
Let's just see how that does.
Again, just like anything in any of these things, nothing is destructive.
I mean, it could be here if we didn't, you know, duplicate this, but because we do that, we kind
of build in redundancy.
So let's have a look generate there.
So it's time to see how well it's done.
So click out.
Okay.
Looks like it's got rid of it.
If I press zero, don't forget zero on the on on the keyboard does nothing but zero on your number pat
renders.
And you know what?
I think that's done a pretty decent job once we run out of the green.
That's when we kind of we don't have any room.
But.
Yeah.
So really good job.
How good is it?
I mean, it's so, so powerful.
If we go into here and exit out, I want to put that back into Premiere Pro or go back to Premiere Pro
and pre render it.
You're welcome.
You can see it's just brilliant.
And if I tell you this in, you can't even see where the car was.
It's such a powerful tool.
I'm actually looking to try and see where it may be and I just I can't see.
Now you're masking and the content to wear may not always be that clean.
And I've already trialled this one.
This is actually Title Lambo.
This also is from Motion, right?
I love the fact that it's a Lamborghini, but I selected this one because there's certain bits that
you need to kind of look out for.
Let me just put it in, in and out so I know where I am.
Once I got Tilde, I'm looking here now and okay, when you when you, when you use content aware to
get something out, what you're wanting is kind of like a clean plate.
And by that, I mean this is all on the gray.
Okay?
You can see the yellow line here.
You can see the white lines here.
However, at times.
As you can see, as I come here, there's the white line is behind the wing mirror here.
And as I come across, the whole car is covering parts of the line.
And that's a really difficult thing for content to wear for for Sensei, the Adobe sensei to get out.
Because not only is it trying to remove this, obviously the whole software is then trying to put in
place something in place of it and it will be really quite difficult to cover this.
So I've already run this once and it's not the cleanest of content to wear fills for it.
However, I want to show you something that we've really got a level of this, and to do that, we first
need to get it clean.
We need to get this content to air fell out.
But I want to show you how you can use it, even if it's not a fully cleaned out version.
Does that make sense?
I think it does.
I'd love to know how many times I've asked, does that make sense?
And there's no one there to reply to me.
But anyway, I've I've made I've made the big mistake.
Made the big mistake.
What have I done?
I haven't opened premiere.
I haven't opened after effects before I've started.
So if you do that, come back here.
I cancelled that off.
So the, the importer reported a generic error.
That's because I cancelled it.
So I said, no, don't take this, I'm going to go to my recent projects and I'm going to select the
one that we were working in and ignore that you get them all the time.
At the moment, I think there's a new update coming very soon, which is why I got a lot of the errors.
But it's fine.
It doesn't really it doesn't really affect anything.
And okay, so again, we're going to go the same.
And as you see, that kind of comes out.
But I'm actually not going to use all of it to be fair.
In fact, let me control that that come back controls at that so undo and I'm actually going to trim
this to where I want it I'd say yeah, it's probably about there really.
And I know what I'm going to do because I've already run this once and I'm yep, I'm not no spoilers,
so I'm going to right click and now replace that with after effects composition go to After Effects
and let's just start with it the closest.
So that's where it is closest.
And we're going to do what we did before.
So with the with Eclipse selected on the timeline, we get the pencil and let's just draw a mask around
this.
So again, using alt on a keyboard and scrolling up zooms in and out.
And if we've got the mouse cursor over here, regardless of what tool it is, if we hold down, shift,
hold down, spacebar.
Sorry, it changes to the hand tool.
That is something that was added into this this program after people cried out for it because we're
so used to using it in Photoshop and it just makes everything easier because this is a compositing.
I know we've spoken about this before, but this isn't necessarily a video and it's app.
This is a compositing software after effects as in adding the effects after the edit if you hadn't already
got onto that naming.
Okay, so let's just draw this mask and I want to kind of definitely want to avoid that all the way
around.
I love the blown diffuser on the back there.
If you know your motor racing, you'll know what I'm talking about.
I'm going to come in here between there and just put another handle there.
And then remember, don't worry, we come down to here, hit M-4 mask and select it as non for now,
the amount of times they're going to subtract and then try and track it, I'm like, Oh no, no, I'm
about four steps ahead.
So here we are right here.
What we do now, can you remember?
We don't got to here yet.
We come down to the mass because it's the mass we want to track.
Now you can go to tracker, and yet it's not the correct dialogue.
But if we go to Mask, I'm going to switch back to my selection tool and press right click and track
mask.
This now comes up.
Okay.
And we're going to have position, the position, scale and rotation.
I looks I have just position in scale, but we won't notice.
So that's done that.
And we're just going to track forward and see how it goes.
And obviously, we're right at the end here.
Right at the end.
So rather than track forward, we're going to track back or analyze back.
So let's let's click that and let's see how it does.
And as you can see already, this mask is it's over these white lines.
It's going to go over these white lines again.
And obviously, the scorch marks from from the rubber from tires, whether it's this car or other cars,
I would imagine it's this car.
So it's just some guys there with the drone.
The guy the guy who's flying the drone might even be in the car.
But anyway, yeah, we're tracking back 100% zoomed in a moment.
So we're not actually showing the whole screen.
But you can see this is tracking back pretty quickly and it's sticking quite well to it.
I can see that it's not really it's it's it's Damascus.
Come inside.
That's that shadow of the wing mirror.
But other than that, it looks like it's doing okay.
We'll see how well that comes out.
We might have to change our alpha expansion just a little bit more.
It's coming back in now, so that's fine.
We can always go into those key frames and change those, but we'll see how well the the actual software
does because it is very powerful.
And now the play had doesn't move back with it, which is a little bit it's a little bit annoying for
me because you can't really see where abouts were at.
But then again, you know, you can kind of see in the video if you're, you know, really familiar
with the footage, the mask has moved out here as well with the with the yellow.
I think Sensei might be able to, it might be able to cover that quite a lot because it knows that line
and it will learn that that line is there.
It's now moving out into the.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see.
We may need to tweak this a little bit, but we'll see.
Okay, so that's our mask done.
I'm not going to touch this yet.
This obviously is all the way out there.
But let's just see how we go.
Okay.
So I'm going to select subtract.
So that's now cut our whole and content to where Phil and going to take the alpha expansion up to eight
not that seven eight and just have that in there it's still an object we still want to do the whole
work area.
Let's generate the fill as you see, as you saw.
That was really quite quick.
I wasn't trying to pat it with with any kind of speech, but yeah, it went quite quickly.
I think you would agree.
So generate fill where in the content to where.
Phil So that's what we've come over to.
We've changed the alpha expansion and we're going to hit generate.
Phil This is the one that will take the time.
Okay.
So this has finished and I think you would agree that first frame, it looks pretty much garbage if
I scroll along.
Once we get to here, if I play there, that looks okay.
You can kind of see just a hint of it and there's little bits here, but generally it's it's not a bad
it's not bad.
And that, you know, okay, that doesn't look great.
But for what I'm planning, the end looks fine.
The beginning bit is not acceptable.
So we need to go in and change this.
So as I said before, the the mass colors are kind of auto generated as you do a different mask, it
brings out a different color.
I it's just so happen that that color is pretty much the same as the sound, so we can't really work
with that.
So we need to kind of change the color of that mask.
We can see what we're working with.
If you come down to the mask here, you see down here, it's the same color.
So it puts that color in there.
So when you've got multiple masks and they're all different colors, you know, which corresponds to
which.
So we're just going to click that right here and we can change the color.
So I'm going actually going to change it to a green maybe and okay, that really stands out good.
And see how that makes it a lot, lot easier.
All right.
What are we going to do with this?
Okay.
Well, we know that the car is actually further down here.
It's not all the way around.
So I've got my pencil.
I've hit shift.
And collect to deselect.
And I'm going to just bring this in.
Now, what this does is it's going to say actually all that content to AFL that you were doing.
Don't do it around here.
Okay.
Just leave it for a bit.
If I come down here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Still kind of doing there in there.
So we're going to bring that down.
Bring that down.
Bring that down.
And yeah, just try and make it just a little bit tidier.
Okay.
Now, if we're looking at these key frames, if we click down again, it goes all the way up again.
So what we want to do is, and this is a little bit of jiggery pokery that sometimes you just going
to have to do.
But if we go all the way to maybe.
Here.
Well, I'm okay with that keyframe.
So I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this and go all the way.
Selecting all of those.
When I hold down shift, I click that first one because we're okay with that one, I'm going to press
delete.
So now this will automatically push itself up to there.
That kind of.
So there's that keyframe, and then there's that keyframe.
Okay.
And this will just move between it.
Obviously, we've got this here.
So what we need to do is we need to run content to AFL again.
Just generate the fill.
So now with those changes, let's generate that fill.
And let's see what we get.
Okay.
So that's done.
Let's have a look how that looks.
Uh, still not great.
If I dislike that bottom one, obviously it's China.
Obviously, it's it's generated another one up here, so let's have a look.
Okay.
That's not tracking.
I think maybe we're going to need to track that mask again, just backwards.
So if we get this mask and change it to none again, I'm going to actually delete these two layers there
to generate it fell last.
The reason why I'm showing you this is because I want to show you when it goes wrong, not just when
it goes right.
The amount of tutorials, amount of courses that I've done and it's like, Yeah, you just do this and
this and this, and then you try it with your footage and it's like, Yeah, but that didn't look like
that, or it didn't work like that for me.
So I think it's really important to not only show when things do go right, but show things go wrong
as well.
So okay, we're now going to track back from here because we're quite happy with this whole track all
the way through here.
Yeah, okay.
We got a little bit here, but it's really no biggie.
So I'm going to come back to this first keyframe.
Now, I'm absolutely certain that that's on that right keyframe, but to be absolutely belt and braces,
you go past it and then you click back to the next keyframe.
Okay.
So what I want to do is I've got my pencil again.
You can see all these are shaded in or yeah, they're complete boxes.
So I'm going to press shift and click one just a D select that and start to move those a little bit.
Just because we don't need that much and we don't need we only need to be part of the car and okay,
I'm good with that.
Now going to right click and track mask that brings up this dialogue again and let's analyze backwards
and see if it tracks it any better.
That's sticking to it a little bit more and watching really around here purely because we don't want
it to be going too much into here.
In fact, let me stop that.
Let me go back.
Remember how we did it with the tracking when we were tracking the movement?
I want to I want to close this up a little bit.
And while we're in here, obviously, we've got all these we don't necessarily need to delete all these
key frames because we're going to connect.
We're going to continue analyzing back.
But from this state of the mask, so it will overwrite anything that's been there before.
So we'll carry on.
This is looking good.
This is looking better.
It's getting a little bit high that some are going to come back about here.
It's just it does have a tendency to just kind of move away in this track.
So, yeah, just a little bit further down.
Let's just get a little bit closer to that car again.
Don't need to delete these things.
Just continue analyzing backwards.
Still growing a little bit.
But this shouldn't be too bad.
Just a don't want it to go all the way out into the sand, which it has done.
So we're going to take it back to where I want to take it to the first keyframe where it goes out.
That's about there.
Now we're going to again, just bring it in.
It's almost like trying to herd cattle or manage children.
Go on, go away.
And we'll continue to analyze backwards.
This is better.
This is good.
Staying away from the sand here.
I'm good.
I'm happy with that track.
So we'll do what we did before.
Just select to subtract.
We've now got that in there.
Go to content where Phil and let's leave the alpha expansion.
Do you know what?
I'm actually going to close up the alpha expansion because I've got a little bit closer.
It's going to take that to five.
Again, as you can see, this is very much trial and error because anyone could say, yeah, this is
how you do in this, how you do it, and this is how to make sure it's okay.
But it all depends on the footage that you're using.
And you saw the previous two that we've used.
It's it's it's gone out in just a matter of clicks, whereas this one just it's just not working as
well or as quickly as the ones before.
And I can't tell you why, purely because I would have said this one would have cleaned out much easier
than the likes of like this one or even this one.
Well, maybe not this one.
That was really easy with the with the single, single person working up here.
I don't know if she was single.
That was a little joke.
But yeah, it's one of those things we just kind of work through and see what we get as we go.
So let's generate the fillet here and let's see how that does.
And so we're done.
Let's just hit playback with the spacebar and see how, if that's done any better.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, it is better.
And to be honest for what we're doing, it's enough.
This has moved over here, which is really quite frustrating.
But it's enough for what we're doing because I'm excited to show you this.
Okay, let me just say that project and let's go back to Premiere Pro and here is our footage here.
So before we go into this, let's pick some music.
I want some like rock music and instead of motion Ray, we're going to go to Art List.
And we spent a little bit of time in here before we're going to spend a little bit more because I love
Art List, I said before.
By the way, I have somewhere else, but I also get stock footage when I want really, really good quality
and options, which I'll show you very soon in an upcoming chapter.
I come here to the footage.
It's not it's artless, but it's the same company.
It's called Art.
Great.
And it's just.
Oh, it's it's brilliant.
It's.
It gives you so many options.
Anyway, we're an art list, and I love it.
So, first and foremost, what kind of music do I think we need?
Well, I'd say we're looking for rock, so let's go.
Genre and rock.
Yeah, okay.
And we all want a short one, but that's fine.
We can make it as short or as long as we want.
But let's have a look.
Grinding bones.
It's a good track, but it's more country.
Okay.
That's not bad.
Let's keep going.
What do I want?
So this is a great thing.
You can.
You can say, right, what do I want and what do I not want in this?
I want guitar, not acoustic guitar.
I want electric guitar.
So add that to I don't want an orchestra.
Definitely.
So that's to exclude I don't want wind instruments.
I don't want any of our.
Just want hard rock.
Oh.
I was almost.
But two happy clappy.
Okay.
So that's 11 seconds where that drops in.
Let me just check my footage because I know what I want to do.
How long is that?
So we've got 57 on the clock.
Maybe I might have to shorten the music, but I do like that, so I'm going to get that.
So download and if you've got the space, always go for wave just purely because it's the best quality
and I'm going to grab this, I'm going to open that in a folder which is all the way off my screen.
But let's just I'm going to put that in our folder, which I will show you bear with.
That's my temporary folder.
There we go.
And let's bring that in and I'm going to put it in audio music.
Remember, we built up this before, just going to copy and paste it into there and I'm going to come
into Premiere Pro and I'm going to drag this where's my music?
My music folder is there.
Drag that into there.
Good.
So let's grab this is called Machete and I struck that in.
Okay.
Let's play this back with the footage.
Okay.
What I want to do.
That really suits it.
But I'm actually going to bring this first hit.
I mean, just cut that.
Let's just check it.
That works for my purposes.
So I'm just going to grab that, put a little bit of a little fade on that and.
Okay.
But that works for me.
So what am I doing?
Well, what I want to push is the options that you get even more so when you've duplicated this track.
Because obviously, if we take this off, if I select it and remember we have zero on the number pad
to enable and disable.
If you haven't already done that and you thought, I'll do that at some point, don't forget shortcuts.
And if you get your keyboard shortcuts and type, enable it shift E by default.
I always put it on zero because I have I have one of these I have a number pad on my keyboard which
is so important for me anyway.
It's great for my workflow, but if I press zero to disable, it's there.
We know it's still there because it's not been mapped out.
So what do I want to do?
Well, I'm just going to listen to the theme music and pick out a few points where I want I want I want
to make a note of where like the the accents are.
So we play this back and with the clip selected, I'm going to use the M key on my keyboard and it's
going to put marks where I want them.
Okay, let's just play this through and I'll explain exactly why.
Okay.
So we have two.
That we have one.
Maybe another one there.
Good.
So what I want to do is I'm going to get to that mark and I'm going to cut this top clip, which is
the the masked out video.
I'm also going to come here and I'm going to do another cut.
I'm going to do here and do another cut.
Now what I want to do is I want to kind of I want to hint at the car and then reveal it.
You know, I mean, because we're looking to mascot like on here, we've looked to Mascot the whole
thing.
And here, remember, we had her on the beach and then we faded her out.
We're going to use similar.
With this, I'll make it absolutely epic.
And to do that, I want to use another plugin.
And we've used it many time and it's premiere composer.
We've talked about the transitions, but the zooming in and zooming out.
What this also has is glitches.
Okay, in the starter pack, there are glitches as well.
The free starter pack that there are glitches in transitions overcome down this digital glitch right
there.
And it does have sound.
It does a promise.
But what we're going to go with is I'm going to go to the this is in the transitions pack that you can
also get.
This is an optional extra.
But I love the TV glitches look and the VHS glitches.
I just love these.
They're just brilliant.
But we are going to use it.
We're going to use the glitchy shapes and the digital glitch.
Okay.
Let me just move this out a little bit so you can see it a little bit better.
And here's a glitchy shapes.
You see all the different things there?
That's quite a good one.
I'm going to use digital.
What I want is I want this one for my reveal.
So I'm just going to put that on there for now.
I'm going to add sound as well.
Okay.
So when we hear it.
Come on.
And we hear it says that you hear that in the background.
Look that without it.
Oh, and if I, if I just disable the music track for now you can hear I just I just love that.
So we're going to leave that there.
We're going to do another one.
We're going to do a digital glitch here.
Yeah, that's a good glitch of that.
So I'm going to add that there.
And we're also going to add one more.
Just on base on this quote here that we made, we're going to use.
One of the.
Yeah, I'm going to use that one.
Love that, in fact.
Can we get a.
Kind of want a bit of argy bargy in there.
That's quite good.
Yeah.
Okay, let's grab that.
And so our glitches are in.
However, nothing has changed other than there being glitches.
If we play this back.
Okay.
In fact, I prefer that there.
Yeah.
Okay, let's, let's swap it round.
So I'm going to undo and a come here and I like that there.
So okay, that's just delete that and delete that.
You see how easy it is to change your mind.
I want that one right there because that's almost like a really big reveal, that glitch.
And then we're going to go here and I'm going to I'm actually going to I'm going to use those lecture
shapes.
I think was it three, now was four.
I'm going to add that back.
So what we want to do now is we want to tease and to do that, this is the aftereffects pre comp which
is obviously come back through and we're going to just drag this off a couple of just a couple of frames.
Let's play that back and see how it looks.
See how was just a hint there.
Now, if you're playing right from the beginning and the view was watching right from the beginning,
they're going to they're going to be already be established with this view.
And it's long enough for them to get established with the view.
And then a little hint of a car will stand out.
Watch.
Saying, Okay, we'll do the same with this one and we'll do the same with the end.
Think maybe a few more there.
And I'm going I'm going to pre render this blind and let's see how it looks because I think this is
going to be absolutely epic.
Oh, I love doing stuff.
I really do.
Okay.
I've also thought of something else to do which could really, really help sell this.
Yeah, but let's grab this first.
Okay, let's play this back and we can move this back now and see how this looks.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot to take this out completely, because we want to reveal it now, don't we?
In fact, I'm not going to delete it.
I'm just going to press 0 to 2, you know?
Okay.
Okay.
I think actually that there's too much intensity.
It doesn't actually it doesn't reveal it, does it?
Because it covers it too long.
So let's go back to a digital glitch and I'm going to go for that one.
And that's probably going to be I think I went I went too much too soon, which is yeah, it's it's
quite a common trait of mine.
I get so excited and go, oh, it's throw this on and this one in this one.
And I mean even even with the years of experience I have, yeah, I can completely overcook things at
times.
So yeah, just dial it back a little bit.
It's all about the subtleties which then build up to it looking, you know, amazing.
So okay, let's do that now what else are we going to do?
Because that's good on its own.
Happy with that.
However, I want to change the color on this.
Why do I want to do that?
Well, because I want to really sell it when it comes.
And not only are we showing a hint of the car, I want to show a hint of difference.
I'll show you what I mean.
Okay.
So we're not going to change the basic correction because basic correction is fine.
By the way, I've selected this clip and I've coming to the color.
If you didn't pick up on that and we're going to go to Creative and the Wall, I know that might be
a good starting point is the gold, which I have in here.
You may or you may not have it.
These have been in my system for so long that I don't know if they're there or not, but I'm going to
go.
Gold Western silver color.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Now we're cooking on gas.
I'm going to take that intensity up a little bit.
I'm going to sharpen it ever so slightly.
And then I'm going to come back to the basic correction.
And I want this to be really blue.
So actually, I'm going to come to curves member Hue versus Hue.
Okay.
We're going to pick this color.
And that's not right.
Is it?
Is that got hints of red in it.
Okay, let's do this manually.
So I'm going to set up handle there, set to handle, then set the handle there.
And I'm going to say hold on shift.
That's not really changing much, is it?
It's really not.
So how do we sort this out?
Okay.
I'm going to take you advanced now.
Are you ready for this?
Okay, so my limit color.
I'm going to duplicate this.
This limit your color.
In fact, you know what?
I'm not I'm going to do I'm going to use what we've what we've worked on before.
And I'm going to move all of this up one by hole.
I've selected all alt an up to take it up.
And then we're going to put in a adjustment layer because we've got color adjustments on here, but
we want to take the adjustment layer that one step further.
Okay.
So we could just grab this, but I'm going to I'm going to do it properly and I'm going to come down
here because there's no space.
And I'm going to right click and click on Adjustment Layer Boom done.
And we're going to drag this all the way through here.
Okay, now we're going to hit color and we're on this adjustment layer now.
Okay.
So the minute I start doing something, we get this created.
Just going to undo that for now.
But I want this limit your color.
And what we're going to do is we just want to mask.
We want to change the color of this sky.
What we're going to do is we're going to mask out.
We're going to mask a certain area with the limit color.
So rather than up here in opacity, we're going to come down here and limit your calling.
You see how we've got the pencil.
I've got this now, 50%.
I'm going to draw a very rough mask all the way around.
Why have we done that?
Well, we're on this adjustment layer.
We've got that mask.
If I now start affecting things, it's only affecting here.
Okay, so what am I going to do is I'm going to bring that temperature all the way down.
So that's really blue now because I'm just affecting the temperature there.
However, once I get into my curves, if I then no, not with that.
If I go with hue versus hue and select that color, I'm now selecting blue and I'm going to grab this
middle handle and I'm going to hold on shift.
And you could change that to any color you want.
I'm just going to give it that little bit more like aqua.
Because now we've almost got orange and teal.
Okay, good.
So if we scrub forward now, I'm just going to make a little mark on here.
If we skip forward.
The Horizon horizons are.
I actually see how it's covering over these, but it's not too bad and it doesn't really need to move
that much.
All I'm going to do is think what could have happened is that as this moved my mask, maybe of a sudden
come light all the way up here because the camera move.
But we've timed it quite well.
So all I'm going to do is in this mask, I'm just going to feather it a little.
Obviously, if I feather it too much, it's let me just click on the mask.
So there's the feathering there.
But don't forget, this handle can be used as well.
I'm just going to feather that across there.
Okay, so that's when out and that's width.
So now if we can you tell them, I'm really starting to have fun now, I feel like I've got you guys
to a place now where I can really start to play and really start to push and show you all these different
types of things that you can do just on a whim.
And that's the beauty.
That's for me, that's the beauty of video editing and being able to jump between Premiere Pro and After
Effects just gives you that next level.
I just, oh, I love video creation, which is probably why I am making this tutorial.
I'm hoping I really do.
You know what?
I'm going to take a second and just I really hope you're enjoying the course.
I really do.
If there's stuff that you haven't quite understood, don't forget you can always go back and rewatch,
rewatch, rewatch, get it in your head and don't forget where you have the course outline and you have
loads of references right at the bottom of that, not just the downloads for all your different plug
ins that you can get a lot of for free, some for a little bit of money.
But also I've got my busier game down there linked, which helps you with the pencil, which isn't the
easiest thing to get started with.
But once you've got it, oh god, it's it's worth its weight in gold.
Learning how to use the pen tool, not just in premiere pro, but in after effects, even in Illustrator
and Photoshop if you ever get into those.
But yeah, I really hope you're enjoying the course and by the time you've finished, you'll be driving
off into the sunset like this.
God is not good.
I wonder if it'll be too much if I kind of punch in a little bit at this point.
Yeah.
I mean, I see that my mask has moved there, so I'm going to have to sort that out.
I know.
Maybe not too much if I go there.
Let's prevent do that again.
Let's see that.
I can hardly tell the changes.
Alex Good.
That doesn't it kind of push it even more.
I wonder.
Yeah, it's good to that.
I'm pretty Renda and I don't need to put you in there, but I just.
I like to.
I'm not making my excuses anymore.
You've heard me say, oh, I pre render enough times now I think this is going to be it.
And I would take this back to the beginning now and have a look at this.
Oh, God, I love this fact.
Some of look.
And that is what you can do with content to AFL.
I mean we just created magic there.
Oh, yes, there are various barriers.
I love it.
Honestly, I love it.
And you can just see just how much you can make with this.
Brilliant.
Love it.
So, yeah, that's the content to where I fell, which is technically how to remove objects in video.


### 13. Write-On Text Effect

So for this effect fact, we're going to continue on with this sequence.
And I don't know about you, but through all this video, how cool it looks, we need a kind of message.
And what I want to do is put here something like Drive the dream or something, okay?
Stick with me.
But where I want it, I'm just going to mute this for now is I kind of want it to come up about here
because that's the end of our footage.
And I want the footage to kind of fade off as the text becomes more there.
You know, it's like part of the story.
But what I need to do first is I need to shorten the music.
And to do that, I'm just going to do it nice and manually.
I'm going to play through I've done this before, but yeah, I'm going to play through until I hear
a beat that I can possibly go with.
In fact, I'm going to go to the end and see how long I can kind of play with.
And let's remind ourselves so firstly where where the music kind of is at this point.
It's still kind of dirty and gritty.
What's it like by the time we get to the end?
Because I want to use this and this and go.
Which is quite cool.
Maybe maybe we can use this kind of comes in to that kind of effect.
Once we get the reveal, let's get a clean like bar.
It may be too long, but let's maybe not.
But back here.
Let's see if we can give ourselves a.
I've made a cut there right on that beat.
It might not be actually accurate, but it's a starting position.
So let's get back here and let's see if we can find a beat around.
But we made the beat, so let's have a nice.
Just about him, probably about there.
Actually, I know the mark is there, but I think it's possibly around there.
Let's it's going to select that audio that the music and just kind of cut.
Yeah, this is upbeat right there.
So let's get back and let's delete this and let's grab this guy and bring it back here.
That looks like the timing might be okay, actually, because we still got a bit at the end if I marry
these up to here.
Yeah.
Okay, let's see if that kind of mix is okay.
Take it back to what?
Here.
I immersive even, isn't it?
Because it's even.
Yeah.
Nice.
Like where we're going with this.
Okay, so where do I want the text to come in?
Probably around there as the drone starts to lift.
So how do I do this?
Well, I want to have an A enough until the end here.
I want enough space to be able to play.
But the video ends here and we're going to take this again into after effects.
So how do I make sure I've got enough?
Well, first and foremost, we're going to look there because that's where we want to start our after
effects.
I'm just going to duplicate this up.
Okay.
We obviously don't really have we don't have the adjustment layer anymore because that's here.
And if I turn that off, we've got this remember when we place that in, but we don't need it for after
effects because all we're going to do is we're going to bring back the visual, the graphics, not the
video.
So we just need that as a kind of as a guide, really.
I'm going to bring that up another track because I'm also going to bring in color mats.
Now, don't forget, you can right click new item and climate, but I'm going to just bring in this
white mat that I already have.
Why am I doing that?
Well, because I want to extend it past and into here.
And the reason for that is and I've never seen anyone do this, it's just a kind of a workaround that
I built into my workflow.
And the reason why is because if I just right click to base and went into after effects, our composition
in After Effects would be this length.
But I want it this length.
Now, what I could do is I could go into that, do that, and then change the sequence settings and
add more time.
But this way, I know I've got exactly enough time.
In fact, I'm going to bring it past a little bit more just to give me a bit of room, because I might
have to put effects on the end of this because it kind of fades out, but not slow enough for me.
So let's deal with one thing at a time and the color mats and the video together, we're going to select
them both.
We're going to right click and we're going to replace with After Effects.
Composition brings it back into after effects.
Let me just go back in and show you it's now compressed those two into one kind of like a nest.
And here they are in there.
So as I said, it would have stopped there.
That would have been the length of our composition.
Whereas with the color map, now we have all of this as well.
Okay.
I'm actually going to hide that.
In fact, I'm going to delete that color, Mac, because we don't need it.
And as a combat paste here, you'll see we have an alpha, we have the transparency at the back.
If there's no transparency, it will be black when it comes back into here.
If I go off to here now, you can see it's black.
If I undo that and come back in here, give it a second to update.
Go on.
Don't make a layer of me.
Let me save that.
Yeah, it would help if I actually turn on that layer because I've hidden it.
Come back and we'll wait.
Okay.
But we don't need it.
Just delete that out and we're laughing.
So let me go back to fit and we're going to start this effect with the right on effect.
So first and foremost, we need some text.
So just like you would in Premiere Pro, you'd go to the type tool that we're going to do that here.
So we're going to grab a type tool there and we're going to I'm just going to right click in anywhere.
You can see it creates an empty text layer and we're going to write drive the.
Dream helps you if you can spell.
Right.
Drive the dream.
Okay.
So first and foremost, let's get that sentence.
If you go to paragraph and center that that takes it over that.
By the way, again, if there's if the things that I click in here aren't here, they will be available
in windows to toggle on.
So they do show here.
Then I'm going to go through a line and we're going to align centered for the composition so that I'll
come back in the middle.
I can see the our anchor point right here is kind of not center, but that doesn't really matter for
now.
If you did want to move the anchor point up here, this is your anchor point tool pan behind, it's
called.
And you could just move it around whenever you want.
We've got that centered now.
Something to also bear in mind in the free version of animation composer.
Remember how that looks?
This is the after effects version of premiere composer within the pack, which is free.
I highly recommend you guys because it's just, it's so, so helpful even at the start to presets and
all that which you can use to your heart's content.
But there's also anchor point mover, which is this little fella.
And if I just dock this down here, it normally lives down here.
And if I select this, you see where my anchor point is there with this these arrows, I can move the
anchor points press right goes off to the right bottom, middle bottom right.
You get the picture.
So that's really handy if you ever need that.
And as I said, it's completely free.
Check your the course outline links at the bottom of that.
I would not sell you short.
I say sell, it's free, so just get it.
It's so handy.
So with this tax we need to change.
I will change the the font first.
I want it to have like a kind of a handwritten effect.
I need to highlight this text first.
If we want to change that and that doesn't work, I want some kind of handwritten.
I know this is going off the screen, but it's just the way I'm I'm recording my screen that could that
work.
Maybe.
Can I do a fake bald?
Oh, my work.
Yeah, I like that.
And what I'm looking for is a couple of things.
First, that if it looks good.
Secondly, I'm looking at the thickness of the stroke because that's something to really bear in mind
with this fact, because we're going to draw we're going to write it on the screen.
But I'm going to use this honestly.
It's a it's a great technique, and I haven't seen it that many places.
It's going to play with this alignment just to make sure I'm absolutely happy with it.
I'm going to place that there.
So the coming along just stays and then that's going to go out.
Okay, cool.
Don't forget, this is just a guide.
We can hide this now because we don't need it now.
We're going to turn off our Alpha Channel so we can see this properly.
So how are we going to write this on?
Well, this is where the pen tool comes in brilliantly.
Okay.
Bear with me.
With this.
It's it's quite a laborious task.
And just if you haven't noticed this already, some of the most effective effects, even though they
may only last for about two or 3 seconds, take a long time.
But being able to do this, it will help you with so many other things by but by writing with the pen
tool, this kind of exercise really, really helps.
So what do we do?
Okay, well, we've got our graphics R text, which is technically a graphic layer selected and we're
going to click on the pencil.
Okay.
What I often do is I will, tilde, to make it a little bit bigger so I can see.
I will also hold down Alt and use that to zoom in and don't forget spacebar to move around.
And then what was simply going to do is we're going to draw or trace the text.
Now just take a little bit of thought because you've got to think about how your pen would pass over
the text.
But it's keeping that in mind.
And obviously, as you can see, I'm working with the pen tool in a way that I would because I'm quite
experienced with the pen tool.
But you could, you could literally just go click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
all the way around if you didn't want to do any bizarre curves, which is what these are or anything
like that, I just find it kind of, I don't know, it speeds of the workflow for me and also helps
with the actual animation, the animation, but you can do whichever way you want.
The reason why I haven't really talked through that is because I wanted to get to this point, because
we've got to think about how the pen would be writing on.
So it will go like down here and then rounds do the drive, don't click them around to the drive.
However, then we want to get off to the R and what we don't want.
Let me just get back to the pen too.
What we don't want is to draw a stroke across it.
Not that it would, because this effect is going to be revealing the text, but just to make it cleaner,
we just don't want to.
So what we do at this point is if we clicked over here, we draw a path all the way along.
Okay, so I'm going to control that there.
And to close off that and start a new path, you hold down control, you see how that changes and just
click anywhere, okay?
These little sizing boxes come back and you can tell that everything's fine because we've got the little
dots and everything's good.
Also, to draw your attention to the fact that this is a brown line.
So this is remember when it was selecting the colours, when we were masking all the different shapes
in the content to our fill.
Well that started brown so I'm now I've press control and click to come out of that one.
I want to start a new mask and let's just see.
We now look at dark green and see how it's changed color.
That will help us if we need to change anything.
Control, click again because I've done the AR I's are quite tricky because you've got to think, how
am I going to duck the eye at the end of the letter or dot the eye at the end of the word?
I often do it at the end of the word just to almost give it a little bit more, I don't know, realism,
self control and click again.
Let's get these all finished.
We've now gone to a yellow mask.
So this is really adding to the to the colour.
And I do that the control click and do the V.
We've now got a light blue.
And I said, I need to keep on telling you about, as you can see, that the mass colors are changing.
And then control click.
And then I notice now hold there with the E, but I'm just going to imagine there is one just to get
that pen movement right.
And we've gone to the E and we finish it and then we go over, no, we don't.
We control click to get out of there and then we need to do the dot and the dots for me.
I just do a couple of clicks all the way around it.
It will probably just appear as a dot, but I just make sure I get the whole of the dot.
Okay, let's just chill out here and let's just show what we have so far.
So if I go into here and I click M.
That's all I'm asked.
See how they're all different colors.
They're all blowing themselves as we go along.
That's what we want, because they're all different mask paths.
Honestly, it will become, if it's not getting kind of clear for, it will become clear.
So there's the first word.
So let's just move on and let's just get the rest of the words done and all the letters following the
same thing that we've done with Drive.
I thought I'd save your sanity and skip ahead.
So as you can see, we have all of these letters written out.
If I tell out and look at all the masks, we have all those masks.
So what do we do now?
Okay, well, I'm going to go fit.
And what we want to do is we want to add a stroke to this, because right now, all this is is a piece
of text with mask masked paths drawn all the way through it.
So what we do is we come over to effects and presets and we search for stroke.
And it's none of these.
We want to generate a stroke.
Okay, so we grab this and we can either drop it on that or we drop it on the graphic and nothing changes
other than up here in our effects controls that brings about.
Yeah.
Those effects controls.
Yeah.
So the effects controls over here, we've got project here and we have effects controls and effects
controls will be different depending on what we have selected here.
Here we have even though it's footage we're not going to be using.
When we used Adobe and Dynamic Link to bring over two aftereffects, it also brought over the limit
recolor the color editing at the color effects grading that we put on here.
If I turn that off, you can see that that was the original footage.
So it's good to bear that in mind that aftereffects will bring over everything that it can really from
Premiere Pro don't need that anyway.
So we're going to go back to Drive the dream and we have our effects controls.
So we have our stroke in here.
So first and foremost, we want to apply this stroke to all masks.
So we check that on and we want to stroke sequentially.
So that means in order, if we go into here and press M mask path one is this one.
Mask path two is this one.
As we go down, look at the M here.
As I click mask 15, it goes two squares.
That's the one that's being affected.
So it's sequentially.
So it's going through each path individually.
What we see is letters this is sees it as paths because that's what we've done.
We've created paths from the middle.
Just close that up for now.
And what we want to do is we first need to brush onto it, but not physically.
We've already done that.
And because this is white, we're going to change the brush color.
Okay.
So we're going to change the color maybe just to a red, just so I can see for zoom in now, you can
see that this this path now has a red because that's what we've drawn.
Don't worry.
You see all these this angle here and all that doesn't matter, because what we're not, we're going
to be animating the paths, but we're not going to be using it as a brush.
I'll show you.
Firstly, we need to size up the brush so the brush covers all the text or as much of the text as you
can, really.
Which is why we change the color.
Because if you're trying to size up a white on white, you won't be able to see a thing.
So I'm just going to 12 is down a bit because you know me, I love a slider.
I'm just going to size it up until all of it is gone as all the white gone.
Don't worry about actually covering up here.
That's no problem at all.
So that's our brush.
Okay.
There's only another couple of things we need to do, and that is, rather than paint style, we're
not an original image.
We want to reveal original image.
In this case, it's a graphic.
So reveal original image.
The red will go and the white will come back.
Okay.
The white isn't baked in.
Bear in mind, the white comes back because we now revealing or with the path we can go to character
and change that color even to like green.
If we want to look done green, but we can leave it at white because we're eventually going to come
out of the video onto black and the white will really stand out.
So finally, what we need to do is we need to keyframe.
Yes.
Our favorite friend.
And what we need to keyframe is the end of the stroke.
Sheila, show you what we're actually doing.
We've said all masks and we said stroke sequentially.
Well, the end is 100%.
If I get the slider and start pulling it back, look.
Look how it's writing backwards in as much as it's taking it all off.
Do you get what we've done now?
We've.
Given it all the paths to write it out.
So we're right at the beginning of our text right here.
If I bring this back on, just show it a little bit more right at the beginning.
And we want to be written by the end.
Okay.
So I want to be kind of all the way in by say about here.
Okay.
So first and foremost, I'm going to come here and I'm going to add a keyframe here at the end.
So that's 100%.
Okay.
Then we're going to bring this back for we don't just going to select this and press you on the keyboard.
Remember to reveal keyframes because we've added one.
We can now see it's brought up the stroke at the end at 100%.
We'll bring this right the way back to the beginning.
I'm going to take the end all the way.
Two zero.
And let go.
And now if we play that forward from the beginning, it goes from 0 to 100.
How good is that?
How good?
Is that?
Now, there's just one more thing I want to do, and I want to ease it a little bit.
Let me just get rid of the video for now.
I want to ease this because this if you remember, we have linear and non-linear keyframes.
And as you can see, because this is a diamond, this is linear.
Remember when we were in Premiere Pro and any kind of keyframe we right clicked and temporal implication
is out even when there's a really easy way to do that.
Excuse the pun, easy way to do that in after effects.
And that is select the two key frames that you want to ease between and press F9 and watch them.
We get little timers and that means it's easy ease.
So ease out and ease in.
And the difference is this.
See how it's slowed down a bit towards the end and it slowly ramps up at the beginning.
Subtle.
But it does make the difference.
So if I control and ask that there are other things that we can do, I mean, we can select those two
and go into a speed graph, but we're not going to do that in this one control and s and that's where
we want to do it.
How easy was that?
So now we're going to go back to Premiere Pro and this is now here and we've taken out the video, but
the video is still playing underneath.
So if we play it, let's just meet the music for now.
Let me go out.
So what's left to do?
Well, it's just simple for me.
But a faint.
So select the adjustment layer and the video below it and put a fade on it.
So now the ending is.
But I just want to do one more thing, and that is, you see how the white on here doesn't necessarily
stand stand out too much until we get to black.
Still want to keep white.
But I want to come back here.
I could actually do this in here, but I'm going to do it in here.
And I'm going to add a drop shadow.
And to do that, just like we have a stroke, we come back to effects and presets and search for drop.
And now we have a drop shadow.
Okay, going to drop the drop shadow on here.
And you can't see that because we're on black.
Another good and handy way as to why we've kept this video.
So now we can see that the DX pops out a little bit more, but not great.
It's a little bit.
Well, there's not really much style to it.
So remember what we've done before we drop shadow, take the opacity all the way to 100.
I'm going to increase the softness.
I think that's about enough for me.
The distance is perfect, obviously.
Say we took the distance here, we could move it around and look.
The only shadow that's being cast is what's currently written.
If I move along.
I mean, that could be the effect that you're going for.
But what I want is I want it further and click, well, closer, not further.
I'm going to hide this track again, control, and come back out.
You see how it pops?
A little bit more than.
And as we go.
Drive the dream.
And the last thing I want to do is just as we're fading out there from that point, I want to move this
to the center.
And rather than doing that in here, we can do that in here.
And all I want to do is just keyframe that position.
I'm going to right click that and ease out and then going to get to the end of the clip there, maybe
a couple of frames later.
I'm going to get up my safe boundaries and I can see that it's not in the center, not going to get
any anchor points here because this effectively is just a video clip because it's being fed in from
here.
So I'm just going to eyeball this and I'm just going to bring that down just a little.
To that.
It creates another key frame and I'm going to ease in.
And that's it.
And just as that happens, we've got this fade out here and I'm going to get this to fade out the same
way.
So I've added a cross dissolve on the end there.
Don't forget, that's my default transition.
And just as that starts to fade out, I'm going to fade that I've done that all without listen to it
because I can see in the waveform.
Let me put it out there and put an in there.
And you know what I do?
I like to pre render and then, oh, I can't wait for this.
I think it's going to look really good.
Don't forget, we all care.
We've just done the right on effects here with this.
But this includes the content to where Phil that we've used to hide the the the car initially then we've
teased it back with opening up the the actual pre-COVID that we sent over to after effects and to reveal
the layer below which we duplicated from.
We've then added a few glitch effects from Premiere Composer, which come with the sound effects as
well to really sell that effect.
And then we've got everything coming in with the drive, the dream, you know, what might be the real
resistance?
Before we get there, I want to look for some sound effects and I'm searching for scribble.
Let's see how this sounds.
Pretty.
That might work.
Know, I just I just thought about it because I thought, you know, where we're selling the effects
with the glitches and all that.
I'm I'm going to I'm going to get this I'm going to get this down as well.
The writing, I don't know.
I could probably look through and maybe find another one.
But no, this is the one I want writing.
And I know it's going to be emotional right down to the bottom writing.
I'll have a number of them.
It was the first one I liked, by the way.
These are all if I tell you this, these are this is probably like the first one, the second one,
the third one.
So any kind of sound effects like this and sometimes with the music give you different versions, but
this is the one I want.
I'm just going to track it down and that looks like it's timed perfectly.
I can see where it ends.
Yeah, that might be just a real happy accident.
Let's make this bigger.
I would tell.
Do it.
But I want you to see all the different things as they come in as well.
And let's let's have a watch and listen.
I'm just going to put a fader.
Got a faded in.
Are you ready?
Sit back and enjoy.
What couldn't we hear?
Couldn't hear the scribble could we wasn't loud enough.
So I'm going to do is I'm going to get to here I'm just going to drag this up a little bit.
That should sort that.
But I don't really like the animation of this.
This wording.
I think with that movement we also need to scale it up a little bit.
So I'm just going to do that, do that and bring in these safe boundaries.
Again, I'm just going to scale up just a little move it down that looks about center.
I'm going to use them both like this.
So I'm just going to ease out and select them both the position on the scale and ease in.
I'm just going to drag it out just a little bit, just so it takes a little bit longer to come out.
Let me just check that scribble again.
Hmm.
Maybe.
Maybe I want to.
What I want to do.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to leave it on there because that sound.
Sound effects.
I'm going to go to my audio, audio, track and track one member.
We've used this before.
Are you Animal Alex?
Audio Butler.
This is music.
And.
Uni mill this is sound effects DoubleClick the music our target volume as let's say three because it
can always be turned up the master medium docking and I'm going to get the sound effects and auto docking
no I don't any auto docking I'm going to leave the target volume is four because I want them to stand
out of the music.
It's good.
Let me hear the scribble.
But mean you could have done that manually over a certain amount of time and keyframe all the sound.
But that's just done it right.
And Joey.
Drive the dream.
Love it.


### 14. Tracking Composite

Okay.
I'm not going to lie to you.
This chapter kind of got away with me, away from me a little bit.
And I went from taking this footage and wanting to add this circle to here to what I'm going to show
you.
But in this chapter, I forgot just how much I love this technique.
And I'm going to show you how to take your footage, stock footage from this.
To.
There's a lot of techniques in this, and we're going to go through each and every one because we've
gone from literally just stock footage of a bit of an outside urban nighttime scene to a projection
of a notification that we've gone to war.
It's.
Yeah.
Get your seatbelts and strap in, because this is quite the chapter tracking composite and everything
that goes with it.
In short, this.
Is moving with the footage.
So a tracking that the composite is everything else that goes into this the footage, the way in which
we make it look like it's on there.
And the audio that goes with it.
Make sure you've got a drink and some snacks.
Let's get into it.
This.
This time, we're going to get our footage from our grid.
Now, I've messaged, I've messaged, I've mentioned awkward before and awkward are the video side of
our list where we got music from.
And they do sound effects.
If I go here and click music and sound effects, this opens up in oh oh, at least for me.
I remember we were in here.
We're picking up music where if we click footage opens another tab.
We don't need all of these.
And this is our footage side.
And I just just there's a reason why I'd like to recommend this as well.
And that's because let's say you're doing some form of video that you want.
So you want this guy and he's a cool looking fella with a mobile phone, but you kind of want options.
You know, you want options with regards to this.
And by that I mean maybe different scenes.
Well, as you can see, I mouse over and I get a preview of what that is.
If I click, it gives me all the information not I'll go back.
That in a second, gives me all the information of what this is available in.
It gives me the tags.
But if I scroll down, this is part of a collection called City Scoot by a contributor, a contributor
called Anna Tyler Pova.
And as you can see, that's the clip we saw.
But if we mouse over these.
This is loads of the same footage.
We also have another person set up just like that and as you can see this plus 55.
So we've got loads from this same shoot.
So not just the same people on the same props.
And so people I say, you know, talent, but we also have the same settings, predominantly the same
colour.
Not just their clothing, but the colour grading as I as I keep scrolling.
I mean, we've got 55 clips that we've got loads and loads of availability in here and you can see what
this story is telling.
They're both now on the scooter scooting away, but she's similar place to him taking a selfie that
they've they've obviously met.
We've gone back over this meeting, but he's there waiting for her.
They take a selfie together.
You can make up a whole story with the guys there.
So make you maybe you're doing a video for, you know, a new messaging app where people can meet people
that's you've got the whole storyboard there.
You just need to download them and edit it up exactly how you want it.
It's such a powerful, such a powerful resource this and just like with the music in in at least once
you download them to go to that, once you download the music here, you have a licence for that to
use everything from everything from online to on, even even broadcast television and even cinema.
And it's the same for the footage.
You can use it in anything that you want.
You have a licence to use it in perpetuity in one project, if you wanted to use the same thing again
in a new project, you just come back and download it again.
Okay, I think that's enough of a sales pitch, although it's not really a sales pitch of of artless.
They're brilliant, they're so good.
And just like with everything that I'm recommending in this course link is in the in the course outline
sheet for where how you can get to this.
And just like with this, I think if you click through, I think they're currently and I think they've
run it forever.
You got like the first two months free or you get two months added for the price of 12 months or whatever.
So the footage we're going to use for this actually comes from a contributor called Alex Botton, and
this is in Montreal, and we're going to use this footage right here.
What stands out to me about this footage?
Well, first and foremost, I like it.
It's gritty.
We've got people here.
We've it's kind of a night scene, but we've got leading lines here that I can really make use of to
track.
So we're going to have that cop.
And we're going to check out.
Obviously, there's nothing to pay for right now because it's a subscription and I want 4K footage right
there.
So that's how I do that crap, that and good that's downloaded.
And I just created a new folder called B-roll Art Grid and an A paste that into that good and going
to track this into premiere pro so straight into here and drag that into here.
Okay so I've brought the footage in here and the best setup for doing this that I found is to obey every
single thing with regards to the footage.
So this is 4K footage.
It's also if I mouse over, it's a 23.976 frames.
It's 4096624096 by 2160.
So yeah, we want to use all of that information.
We want to set up our sequence that obeys all this army short and quick way to do that rather than starting
control and and starting new sequence and trying to feed all those in.
All we do is we just right click and we go down to new sequence from clip.
Okay.
So it creates a sequence for us.
It names it what it is and it puts it where we've created it.
Okay.
I'm just going to rename this as tracking come opposite, hit enter and we're in here and that's now
changed.
So going to do just as what we normally do, we're going to hold down alt and drag up to create a new
layer.
And where are we going to go?
Yeah, you guessed it.
We are going to go to After Effects, right click and replace with After Effects composition.
And here we are in here with our clip.
Now we have tracked things in here before.
And what I want to do is I want to track this area here and we could use the tracker and we could create
a mask and track that on here.
However, there's a much more powerful tool within after effects.
It didn't used to be, it used to be quite a lot of money.
And still the pro version is still quite a lot of money.
However, the company who make this system, which is bias facts, they make what's called mocha mocha
pro azn you know, a macchiato.
Mocha is in is a cup of coffee and chocolate mocha.
So they make mocha pro and Adobe signed a deal with them in recent years and they have actually included
a light version of MOCA in After Effects, which is so, so helpful.
And I think the reason why Adobe did this was because Boris's Boris of X's tracking algorithm is better
than any other on the market.
I mean, you'd have to probably go to maybe the likes of Red Giant or another plug in and software developer
within this realm to get close to the quality.
So unlike other other effects that we would use within after effects, we need to have our clip selected
and we go to effect.
And Boris actually has its own subsection within effects and it's a MOCA a that we're going to do anywhere
through here once as you've got your layer, whether it be, you know, video or photo or graphics or
a vector or anything.
Once you've got that selected, when you come up to effect, whenever you select anything here, it
adds it.
Okay, I've got a few in here that you may not have.
I Digital Anarchy Beauty Box.
I work a lot in the beauty industry with my company and sometimes we just need to retouch, but not
too much.
I kind of.
I stand against a lot of that anyway.
I'm not going to get my soapbox out today.
So we go to Bias Effects MOCA and click MOCA eight.
Now what that's done, although you can't really see anything, it's added corner pins.
If I click out you can't see when I click in.
Yeah, okay.
It's not there anymore.
But if we go to our effects control, you can see now that we have little circles around here, you
may you may not be able to see that.
That's no problem.
But here is where we have our MOCA.
Just another recap.
Just like in prime, you probably have effects controls.
And if we click a clip, we have stuff here about in my house.
So this is the pre comp that we've we're currently working on in in after effects but that has effect
controls as to controls that has effects controls.
In here.
The only thing that we have right now in our effects controls in after effects is MOCA.
And to launch MOCA, it already tells you launch MOCA.
We click the logo and what this is going to do is it's going to open up effectively another program,
but it's another program like, like premiere pro into after effects.
So it's kind of, it's kind of another program, but it's working with the other program.
So effectively, we're two layers deep now.
We're working on MOCA, which is working in After Effects, which is working in Premiere Pro.
And I mentioned earlier on in this in this course, if you're a fan of what's the film, if you're a
fan of Inception, if you haven't watched Inception, you should watch it.
It's Britney.
It's all about my dreams and going so many layers deep.
Anyway, you'll get this splash screen from Boris.
This is MOCA Pro.
Just very briefly, if I bring up MOCA Pro and we have a quick look here at the MOCA Pro, what this
does is it goes even further.
So it's working on if you see these two clips here, it's working on the mesh and you can see not only
do we have like maybe a bounding box around it, but also we have the mesh working out the different
perspectives because obviously a basketball is rounding in parts and that logo that's been placed on
it is really quite accurate.
It's just it's an amazing tool.
If we look here in MOCA Pro, let's just mute that.
You see how the.
It's so clever.
It's using mesh and creating everything within this system.
I mean, this is so many levels up from even what I'm capable of.
It's such I mean, look at that.
I mean, that really gets me.
I watched this a couple of times, but that is this is Hollywood.
So you've got blue screen.
They've obviously chosen blue rather than green, probably because we've got greens in the likes of
the uniforms and stuff.
But if we click that through all this, is is this the Umbrella Academy?
I think it is.
If you haven't seen the Umbrella Academy on Netflix, it's fantastic.
But if I click through.
I mean, this is mocha.
And what Mocha will be doing is it will be tracking all these surfaces and then whatever they place
in well will move around in the scene.
Correct.
To all the tracking data, we're going to do a lot lower lower intensity than than this.
But this is what Mocha Pro is capable of.
I mean, look, that's with the t shirts and he's putting on a logo and you can yeah, you can spend
hours and a fortune on mocha but yeah we will get that.
Ah, there you go.
As well as another example.
I wonder why they used a picture of me.
I wish, but you see how again, this has a green outline on one arm, a green outline, another a green
outline on the torso.
And this will be three different tracks, all with meshes in there as well.
You see how you've got the triangles and the triangles will move in within it.
And to track that, it's literally very similar to what we're going to be doing in this.
But then just even more detailed.
And that's what you get when you get the pro.
But the pro is very expensive.
We're talking like 300 GBP right now for the for for kind of like the standard version, which is higher
than the lite version that we use is built in in after effects.
But yeah, if, if this kind of thing really kind of gets you going, you should really look into two
bars of X and mocha, a mocha pro.
It's brilliant.
So anyway, without further ado, we are now in Mocha and we're going to do something so much less intricate
than what you just seen.
However, it does take a bit of time to get your head around, and that's what I'm here for.
So first and foremost, we're going to start with the explained tool, but what is that?
Well, it's just a name.
And in all honesty, it's just a pencil copier.
Females of a create explainer, explain layer tool, and we're going to click on that.
And then what we're going to do is we're going to track a certain area of this.
And what I want to do is I want to track this surface here.
And the reason why I picked this surface is because it's going to be probably one of the easiest to
track, because we've got we've got a line down there, a line there, a line there and a line there.
What I would like to do is kind of come all the way out.
And you know what?
I'll try that first and see how accurate I can get that track.
But yeah, we shall see.
So if we we start as we mean to go on and we need to click somewhere.
So I'm going to go and click right at the top corner here.
And we now have a point.
Okay.
So as you can see, we've got bloom, we've got red here.
The blue is the handles, the red is the line, which will be the bounding area.
But as you'll see as we go around, the red will start to round off and the blue will stay rigid.
And you'll see what I mean.
And what we're looking to do is we're trying to you can't see right now, but right behind that red
line is actually a dashed blue line as well, which we'll see once we do the next point that we start
to move out from there.
And what we try to do is we try to line up the blue line.
So if you come down here and click right there, and if I start to move out now, I'm not dragging,
by the way, I'm just single clicking my left mouse button.
And can you see the blue?
I wish I had two mouse points as you see the blue dashed line around here.
As I move out, it starts.
It starts to create.
Can you see it?
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to line that up along this line here.
So if I come down here, I'm going to yeah, I'm going to try and try and track all the way to the end
here.
So I'm looking along this vertical here to try and find a point where I can click on there.
And the dotted, the dashed blue line is set right along this line.
So let's see if we can find that down a little bit.
I'm thinking maybe about there.
Now, remember the footage that we just saw before with the blue screen and all the dots all the way
around it?
The dots in the Xs, in blue screen, in green screen.
I think if more and more tracking points for the ED for the motion graphics artist, which is kind of
what we're doing here, it's motion graphics.
So now I'm going to set this point here.
I'm now going to try and trace that dotted blue line looking down here as I move up that dashed blue
line up there.
I'm trying to line that up with the wall going vertical and get this top corner at the same time.
If I click that that's now created the four points that I want to track.
So what do I do now?
Right.
Well, it only obeys the last left mouse button.
Okay.
So once I'm happy with it, I all I wanted to do is do the full.
I think what actually I might do is I might do another point here just to kind of a belt and braces.
So let's click that back and that's good.
And I would now want to close it up so I don't click overhead to close it up.
All I do is right click on my mouse button and that finishes it off.
Okay.
Happy with that?
In fact, what I want to do is in a control z come back and I'm actually going to put a points here
as well just to kind of just to make it absolutely spot on or at least as accurate as I can.
So last one and right click and we're done.
So this in in a sense has given MOCA the first layer, but layer not the right word, the first guide
for our tracking.
But now we can help it even further because we've got to think of perspective as well.
And what do I mean by perspective?
Well, if we if you look at your screen right now, whatever screen you're looking at, if you're looking
at your screen, the perspective that you're looking at it at, if you're sat right in front of it is
straight on.
It's absolutely straight up.
And there's very little in terms of a different perspective.
You are perpendicular to your monitor, your screen, whereas this wall is not straight on.
This is kind of like off to the side.
If we were looking straight ahead, which would be possibly this lamppost, if you move your head to
the left to look at here, you're looking at an angle.
And that's kind of what we're talking about.
We're talking about angles.
So the perspective of this is going to be slightly off as opposed to if it was right in front of you
and straight.
Another way to kind of see that is to think about vanishing lines.
If we look at these lines here, that line going all the way along that and maybe this line down here,
the bottom going all the way along here, you could say that this line is going is traveling from bottom
left towards top right, because it's going up and right up here have top left and we're kind of going
down to the bottom right.
So because we're going down in the screen and to the right.
So it's safe to assume that if these lines were to continue, at some point, they would meet at the
point where these two lines meet, met, make sense, grammatically correct.
The point in which these two lines would meet would have met more support.
Now, that would be called the vanishing point and would be way off here, like way over over to the
right hand side.
So that's what we kind of want this program to think about as well, the vanishing lines, because anything
that we put on here, we want to think we want it to obey the same laws as the vanishing points of here.
That helps whatever graphic we put on here to obey it, if that makes sense.
So to give it even more of a fighting chance, what we need to do is we need to use these two tools
here.
So we need to click this 1/1, which is to show a plana surface.
Now that brings in a box.
This box has no perspective in it right now.
And now when this is all laid off to here, you can see just how different this box is, the one that
we traced out compared to this box.
I mean, neither is actually a box if we're going to be accurate.
Both are rectangles because they're long they're taller than they are wide.
But it's definitely this definitely shows you how different a perspective this surface is that we're
trying to track.
So now that we've clicked this on, we're going to bring on another guide to help us with our eyes.
And that is this right here, which is the plan, a grid.
This is toggle ball talk a little.
Yeah, you can toggle this on and off.
So if you click it, there's a grid again, we get rid of it, so we want it on.
And again, this is just kind of an extension of the blue box that we brought up.
So what do we do with this?
Well, first and foremost, we need to move these corners to obey these corners, the corners that we
kind of that we put in.
So let's start at the top left and you'll see how this rectangle also has the corners extended out on
them.
And once I start moving this, the outside corner will turn red.
Okay.
And that's just showing that just kind of gives us another color.
So it's not blue on blue because we're looking at these blue handles now.
So I'm going to try and get this corner of these two of this corner right in there.
Good.
There we go.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
We can zoom by the way and click on the on the zoom button and then we just drag in like this.
It's not it's not like it's a bit clunky.
It's a bit annoying.
Within here we can go to the hand tool so we can move it around, which is helpful as well.
It's not it's not the same as in after effects where you hit spacebar and drag around because it just
start playing it there.
We don't want to be doing that.
So let's go back to our selection tool and I'm just going to get that right in.
I think that's very accurate enough.
It's come down to here and do the same with the bottom corner.
I do wish that it kind of magnified, you know, like in After Effects, it magnifies when you start
dragging around the tracking point.
It doesn't in in mocha, but that looks quite good.
I'm happy with that.
Let's grab this and put it into this corner.
Go on.
And now if I zoom out, if we look at this grid as a whole and just move this stuff pressing play.
Let's check this back.
I spend most of my time in after.
Not necessarily MOCA.
You see here, if we're looking now at this grade, this plan, our surface, you can see that we've
corrected three points, but this is leaning way out.
And what is going to bring this back in to kind of mimic this is this point here.
So as we bring this down, you'll see that it starts to really obey that surface.
Are we happy with that?
Yeah, I think so.
So I'm happy with that now that.
Okay.
Have done a little bit more tweaking just to make it absolutely was accurate as I think I can make it.
And yeah, well what we're kind of going for is to think that this great if it was pushed back, would
it obey these lines?
I think it would.
I think it would.
So let's see how we go.
So we now want to track this, but we don't use these controls down here.
This is just to play forward, play backwards and go frame by frame, forwards and backwards.
We use these over here the track motion options.
And because we're looking at perspective, we need to toggle on perspective as well.
For some reason it's toggled off by default.
So we want to track it.
So we use here because we're right at the beginning, we just track forward and see what Mercado's.
And this is where you can really see whether everything that you're doing is accurate and if it's obeying
everything on it, it looks okay.
I think I think it's tracking correctly.
It looks alright.
I mean, this is done in real time.
She's doing it frame by frame and it does look like it's obeying everything.
Yeah.
Because you see, the thing is, although you can't really make out, this will be changing in size
a bit, which is why we're tracking the scale as well, because as the camera moves, even, even like
a micro movement forwards or backwards towards it, as it moves forwards, it will grow in size and
backwards it will decrease in size.
So that's what this is tracking as well.
Along with the rotation, the skew, the transformation and the perspective.
It's doing a lot in one job, really.
But hopefully this looks like quite an accurate track and it will give us something that we can work
with.
As you can see, I haven't paused this.
This is real time and it's doing it frame by frame.
And yeah, a couple more moments and it looks like we should have our track complete.
We done.
Don't crack it.
So what do we do?
Well, let's go back and let's see how that track is done.
So we bring it back to the beginning and play a real time.
There's a bit of movement there right at the beginning.
If I stop that the first few frames, if I press play again, it does move a little, but from that
point on.
It seems to track.
Yeah, quite well.
And this starts to ping pong, it just does that by default.
So it goes forward and then goes backwards.
So I'm just going to pose it here and let's just drag it slowly to see where that movement is.
It's kind of too there, isn't it?
I come forward a little bit more and I'm going to grab I'm going to zoom in a little bit.
He says a little bit and I'm just going to grab my selection tool and just kind of bring this up further
into these corners.
Just.
See how it's moved off a little.
It's not quite accurate.
Hmm.
Let's track that backwards from there.
See how that does.
That seems to be holding on it better.
Okay, let's play forward and see how that does.
Still that was shift for think.
I think we're good.
I think we're good.
Okay.
Fingers crossed.
Famous last words.
Okay, so I'm going to zoom out a little bit more and what we do now.
Well, we just save it.
We either go to the file and save a project or just control an S on your keyboard.
And that has saved all that data.
So we can just close that now.
We can always open it again by coming up here and launching marker again with this selected.
But right now, we have all our tracking data in here.
And if we well, down here, all we need to do is click create tracking data to get that tracking data.
Okay.
So we click it and it's going to pick up a little dial dialog box here.
Now, in previous versions of Marker, maybe about 12 to 18 months ago, this cog was turned off by
default.
And I've got no idea why.
Because that's what we're working on, working on layer one, although it's not title layer one, that's
what marker calls it.
And the cog was turned off.
So just keep an eye.
And if that cog is turned off, just make sure it's turned on and we just press, okay?
And now what it's done is it's created all that tracking data.
You see these these are corner pins.
So that's the top left corner pin.
That's the bottom left, bottom right, top right.
And the center is a corner pin as well.
But we yeah, it's not a corner, but it's fine.
And as we drag through, you can see that those corner pins, they move with that.
That's all the data right there.
So how do we use this?
Well, we need to create something to then be able to put in something.
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a placeholder.
But one thing I forgot to show you, if I go back into marker.
As I said, you could easily just open a locker again.
Closed all back, closed all that.
And they still has our tracking data all the way through.
If I select it, there's all our stuff we've got our plan, our surface data as well.
But a way to check this within MoCCA is if you go to Layer Properties and go to insert clip and handily
MOCA provide that logo just in case you were unaware that what you were using.
We've got MOCA and if we press play now.
That kind of shows you whether your track is accurate.
You see what I mean?
Because rather than just the boxes, it's giving you something to stick to it just to kind of give you
an idea if it has tracked well, and I'm I'm quite happy with that.
That looks quite good to me.
But the proof will be in the pudding.
Control and asked just to savour.
Didn't need to.
I didn't really change anything other than put this in.
But this never exports with it.
It stays within MOCA.
And so we've got our tracking data, we created it.
And all we need to do now is we go to right click new and solid excuse of black solid for now remember
like you got column that's in Premiere Pro.
We have black solids in here we have solids in here and it gives you it gives you the color names who
have done that medium red.
So I love that I wish Premiere Pro would would label the color as well rather than just saying you know,
color matte.
But yeah, I've been waiting for them to do that for years.
I going to press.
Okay, and now we have that color right in front of us.
Nothing's gone.
We've just got another layer above.
So what we want to do is we want to take the tracking data from this clip from MOCA and we want to put
it onto this solid.
So what we do is we click on the actual clip in our timeline.
I mean, to export this tracking data that we created so we create before, remember, we made sure
that the cog was turned on and then we just go layer to export and we're going to rename this.
I'm going to I kind of named it the point where I created it, but I forgot.
So I'm just going to say this call this tracking place holder I'm press enter I'm just doing that so
the name will come up easily on here so we can see what we're doing.
Okay.
So what we do is we make sure that corner pen is selected.
We don't want corner pens for motion blur or transfer.
We just have transform even we have corner pen selected dropdown, the layer to export to and click
tracking placeholder.
And then we just simply click apply export and there is everything put up to there.
And now if we press play.
It's pretty good, isn't it?
I mean, it's really good.
So now we want to get something on here.
So what what do we do to do that?
Well, it's a little bit of a trick.
And what we're doing first is we need to nest this.
So then we can use it.
And to do that, it's not called a nest in after effects.
It's called a prick jump.
So I'm going to right click and I'm going to pre compose.
And what we do well, this dialog box doesn't always come up whenever you're making a pre composition.
It has now because it knows that this has a load of information and it has all the tracking data in
it.
So it gives you the options.
Do you leave all attributes in the project or do you move all attributes to the new composition?
We want to keep them on the outside.
All of us here, we want to keep it on the outside, not on the inside.
If we left it on the inside, it would it would screw everything up.
So we leave all our attributes in the project and we open the new composition.
So what this is going to do is it's going to nest it effectively pre compose it, and then it's going
to open this in a new composition, which will then go all read again.
Watch.
Okay.
But this right here is just this right here.
Okay.
So what do we do now?
Well, I made something in Illustrator.
I made a circle.
You can use anything, by the way.
And I will show you towards the end that you really can use anything.
But I made just a nice little graphic to go into here, and I've called it Circle.
It's just a little bit of a vector art and I don't know, I'm starting to really play with vector art
and all that kind of stuff.
And I just I just like it.
So here's my vector art.
I like it.
It's pretty.
And I have dragged it into here.
Circle.
Okay.
As you can see, it's the after after effects.
It's the illustrator.
It's a I, it's the illustrator file.
I'm just going to drag this down into here.
I'm going to hide this solid, and you can't see it because it's black.
So then I turn on the Alpha Channel and there we have it.
If we click back.
Lucky.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
And if I press play.
It's their right.
Okay, let's play with this now so we can now size this up.
So I'm going to select this.
I'm going to press S and I'm going to yeah, I'm just going to size up for the middle.
So we just size this up all the way.
I'm going to put it as big as possible, and I'm also going to turn on continuous rasterization which
which will cut down the anti-aliasing.
If I turn this up to full, it kind of looks okay, but there are still jagged edges.
So I'm going to turn on this right here, which is if I must tell me ra rise.
Yeah.
To continuously pasteurize and that just means it will continuously read from it to avoid any kind of
jagged edges.
If I come back here now, we now have this guy and as we play along.
Mm hmm.
I wasn't there before, was it?
So as you can see, this is kind of taller than it is wide.
That's purely because the tracking has squeezed this and because this isn't.
This right here is the same aspect ratio as this clip.
And because this is now shorter within that, it's taller than it is wide.
If that makes sense.
So all we can do, we can make it wider so it squeezes less.
And just like we size up and down with scale.
While that's keeping the height as well as the width, this little linking button here, if we turn
that off, it's the constrained proportions.
I would never be able to tell you that.
It just means that it's as tall as it is wide.
If we turn that off and now start pulling the left one, we go wider.
Similarly, if we play with the right one, we go taller.
So if we go wider for us and then we come back, you can see we're now circle.
That was quite flick.
Alex.
Good, isn't it?
But let's say I want it to be white.
How do I make this white?
Well, there's two ways.
We still have this file.
So we could change that in Illustrator.
However, you might not have the file.
You may just have a PNG or something, and you might want to change this colour.
And you might not want to edit it because you're not able to edit it.
The easy way to do this is to come into the pre comp and we want to go to effects and presets and we're
going to go to start typing colour.
And depending on whether your language is English, UK or American UK, you may be spelling colour differently.
We have to obey the the U.S., the American version of color which does not have a you.
This is how you spell colour in UK English.
C.
O.
O.
U.
R.
But just remember there's no u in American.
What we want to do is we want to change to color.
Okay.
So we drag this onto our circle.
And right up here, we now have in our effects controls.
Change to color dialogue and this is black, so we're going to pick it member our picking tool, we're
going to select black and we want to change it to white.
So white is already selected.
Let's just change it to a different color just to kind of show you the change to red and we're going
to select hue, lightness and saturation and that lets you changes everything.
And we go back and now it's red.
That makes sense.
That's the easiest way to change the color in after effects.
It's it's a little known.
It's a really little known tool, but it's really helpful.
So let's go back here and now that's red.
Good.
However, it doesn't quite fit, does it?
Because it really is standing out.
So we need to make it look more like the whole surface, like it's actually they're not being projected
onto that.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to motion array.
Remember, emotion array.
We've got it up here as a plug in.
I look so data.
Good.
What I what you also have with the plug in is you have the whole source is that the whole online source
that you can use actually web based.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and look for I mean, technically photos, I would imagine
I want an overlay.
So I'm going to go for like a like a gritty.
Yeah, let's, let's say concrete.
Concrete.
So let's see what it brings us.
Yeah, okay.
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Good.
So grungy concrete.
That's the one that kind of stands out to me.
Outskirt, isn't it?
Yeah, like that.
Okay, so we can we're going to download that and there's my grungy concrete JPAC.
And if I if I get that, I'm going to put that in images in our thing.
You see how it's so important to have all your all your folders all set up, how you want them to look.
Circle is in here as well.
It's just, it's just so important because if you ever need to refer back to something, it's great
if you just leave everything.
Say, I've downloaded that, that came into my downloads folder.
If I left that in my downloads folder and then just work from it and then once I finish that.
Okay, cool.
And you know how you know how full and chock a block your downloads folder can get.
Sometimes it all about you, but I kind of rage.
Quit and just select everything and shift and delete bypass the recycle band.
Go identify a couple of months down the line.
If I still got this project and I double click and open it, well this will have been deleted along
with anything else that I just left in my downloads folder.
So try and avoid that at all costs.
So I'm going to come back to After Effects and go into the project area and I'm going to drag in my
grungy concrete on here and I'm going to go into this pre comp which is open here.
I'm going to drag this just on top.
So that is my concrete.
If I press s to scale and p for position.
Okay.
Yeah.
So it's kind of put it to the size alt and scroll up and down on my wheel if I need to replace it.
I'm just going to get it the same size as this.
And then what we're going to do is we're going to do something a little bit clever, and we're going
to use this as a what's called a Luma track map.
If I tuck all my switches here, I have track maps available.
And what this does effectively is it creates I'm using the Luma part of this.
So remember when we were in Premiere Pro?
Yeah.
Didn't look quite right at the moment, does it.
If we go into colour, I remember in our, in our curves we had down here we had Hue versus Luma and
Luba versus SAT.
Well the Luma is the luminescence and that's kind of what we want to take from this.
But what we're not going to do is we're not going to.
This isn't to affect this image.
We're going to use the circle underneath to punch through it.
And to do that, we just drop that down and go to Luma mat.
And you can see it will always be affected by what's above it.
So grungy, concrete, background, texture, boom, done.
And all of a sudden we have this real concrete texture feel.
And if we come out of here.
And leave that to update.
Outlook's much better.
Much better.
I'm actually going to scale this out a little bit more.
Not that one.
Although I might have to.
I bring this out now.
Let's unlock it and scale out a little bit more.
You see how we're now getting off the sides of the concrete, so we need to scale back up so it totally
covers it and come out a bit more.
That looks better if we play that back.
It's brilliant control as to save that that's compact premiere pro.
Let that update.
Come back to my editing and there we are.
Once everything kind of catches up.
And yeah.
So if we play that back now.
We're fully tracked.
And now that we have that in there, we can put whatever we want in there.
Let's say we want another piece of footage.
Let's get some footage from.
Just a quick bit of footage from.
You have motion away.
I should just size this out a little bit so we can see.
Well, playing.
And okay, let's try something.
I'm going to get this down, which is like a countdown and then let's let's put maybe invasion.
I'm trying to think, like, maybe alien thinking.
Maybe.
She looked like an alien.
I'm thinking about maybe, like, putting, like, you know, like something up here.
Like, there's an alien invasion attack.
It's just pop.
Might be war.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe this.
Well, I thought the helicopters coming over.
If they come over any time soon.
Do they?
Yeah.
Let's do that.
So we'll grab that.
And bearing in mind that we've done nothing in as much as we haven't gone out with the camera, it's.
It's all here.
It's all through stock footage, obviously.
I mean, I made this little graphic, but that really didn't take that much.
And we've got helicopters flying overhead and a vintage countdown sequence.
So if we go into motion array and we go for helicopters, wake up to fly overhead, it's going to drag
that into there.
And we've got vintage where it is vintage countdown sequence, a track that's here.
And the reason I'm dragging it on here is because I want to time it because we're on top of our other
footage.
So if I if I go, I maybe go from three.
Yeah.
And three cut back and delete that, bring that back to the beginning.
And then we know that our helicopters don't come in any time soon.
So we're going to go from baby back and delete that and bring that over here.
Faculties era go.
Okay.
Cool.
I'm happy with that.
Bring that up.
This is what I'm doing on here, as I said, is because where I want to time it, I'm quite happy with
that there now.
So I'm going to move them off there exactly the right time.
And I'm going to create in fact, I'm going to do that in after effects.
And this like these two right click replace in after effects to do two these two things really I'm going
to do a transition between these two in after effects, but I'm also want them in after effects because
I'm going to place them somewhere else and I'm just going to go between these two clips.
Got a window animation composer.
Remember, this is the after effects version of premiere composer right here and I'm going to filmic
transitions.
Is that like a burn, maybe a light leak?
You no glitch.
You don't me.
I love Mac lectures.
That's good.
You see this so many more, it transitions and all within the after effects bit just purely because
it's got it's got the processing power.
It's just it's amazing.
So there's my that says go.
And then back to lectures to.
This coming out of good.
I'm happy with that.
This is all good.
This is our project.
One linked cop25.
Okay, so this is currently where we're at.
I'm just going to close that for now.
This is what is currently showing on there.
So if I go find our link to Project 25, which is will be in here.
And there's 25.
I'm going to now drag that into here.
That's a pre comp as a pre comp and give it a bit of time to get there.
And if I'm going if I come in here and I turn off the circle and come back here, this should now update.
And yes, it has.
And if I press zero on the keyboard to pre render.
This now starts to count down.
You see what I'm doing?
It's a little bit too much in as much as it looks too real.
So if I turn that off, that's that and that's that.
So what I'm going to do is I'm now going to take these two, you know, take these three.
I'm going to pre compose those, move all the attributes because I don't really need that.
And then when I come back here, there's a pre dumped.
Which is 25, which is -- good.
And I'm going to grab this concrete.
I'm going to place it above that prick.
And I turn it back on.
I'm going to size it up and then going to hide that.
I'm going to take this pre comp, I'm going to deselect because I want to stretch it out.
So about there.
That's what I want.
Maybe.
Yeah.
No, I'm happy with that.
That's been pretty cut back and I turn back on my concrete and what the area is.
And I'm going to drop down and I'm going to Luma mats again with the concrete above.
So then what that will do once everything kind of catches up with itself is we've got the concrete effect
over just going to control as at this point come back and have that will update.
So it should have the concrete effect overlay.
There we go.
And if I control as there, come back to Premiere Pro and it sets an output points here, an endpoint
there and pre render and then we'll see once this is fully pre-rendered just how effective and what
you can do once you have successfully tracked a surface and all this is thanks to the technique is all
thanks to.
Mocha from Boris Effects, and it's the after effects version of Mocha, which is built in to after
effects.
If this doesn't make or if this hasn't made the case for keeping your software up to date and for paying
for that subscription with Adobe, I don't know what would.
This is going to take a little bit of time to pre render or come back when it has.
And so there's a sequence all pre-rendered out.
Let me make this a little bit bigger.
If we play that through.
Well, he looks good, doesn't it?
Right.
Let's really sell this then.
If we come back into here and go to some sound effects, let's go for Baby City.
Just kind of want city.
Night o night.
Urban Ambient.
Review.
Preview.
That sounds kind of something that we want.
Let's get that down.
I also want maybe an air raid because this is like an announcement.
Air raid siren.
That's good.
Let's drop that down.
Good.
And then I want some.
If we have helicopters.
I haven't touched any of these before.
So we we you know, this is just this is how preview.
Yeah, that's what we want.
This is just how much I believe in motion or I just it just has everything you need download that's
all down cracking.
So if we come back into motion, right?
We want the helicopter pack.
Where's the helicopter park?
There we go.
South.
Let's just try the first one.
That will do if we have that coming about.
I'm looking here as to when the helicopters come in.
I'm going to maybe start it from before they drag that in.
Doubling up as well.
So that's Alton Drag.
I'm going to bring that up for the second one.
As good luck.
Get there.
Let's cut them off and get rid of that.
And then what I want is the West download the air raid alarm siren air raid alarm siren.
Yeah I'll do will grab that and put that here.
You see, I'm doing this in like literally no time.
All I know when the helicopters commence, when to cut that and get rid of that little faint on the
back of that.
So that will play like this.
I was going to leave that, actually.
Maybe all that.
Maybe all the way through, actually.
Good.
And then just a really sell out.
I want my Nate urban ambiance, which will be here and just check in the first one that I'll do.
Maybe bring that up so it's straight in at the time.
Put a fade on all of them.
Cut off the end there.
I'm going to select all of those shifting now.
I'm going to select control and select all of these to do shifts and a fade out.
I'm going to have pre compose that.
And then let's have a look how it looks.
And those guys don't really seem bothered at all.
How good is that, though?
Seriously, it's it's I don't know about you, but the ambience at the end really sounds it.
If that wasn't on.
That's all well and good, but with the ambience on.
It's all these little things that help to sell it, just like we're tracking this and tweaking it and
putting a grungy effect on there so it looks like it is being projected onto there.
But yeah, it's everything like that that helps to sell it.
And yeah, that's our tracking composite.
I know it's a long one.
I know it was a long section, but I hope you'll agree there are so many different little lessons throughout
all this that help all go towards this effect.
So impressive.


### 15. Text Message Effect

So this effect has been used in a number of Hollywood and TV shows.
It was first really seen in in Sherlock, which has such I know we've mentioned it earlier in this in
this series with regards to transitions, but it's effects like this that were were groundbreaking in
Sherlock.
And if I tell you this, show you back.
There's a number of effects going on here.
We're tracking everything.
We've got his text messages being superimposed on and actually moving with the camera to really sell
it.
And we have a sign on the back totally the most accurate description of the airline that this guy is
flying with right now.
So let's get into it and show you exactly what techniques and how many of them are being applied to
this one little clip.
So to start off, we need some footage.
And the footage we're going to use for this is in our grid.
And I love I love this clip.
I think it just it tells a lot.
It's in this story here.
It's this guy here.
So I'm going to I mean, not grid and I search for travel phone and one because you can select how many
people.
I just want one person and it's this guy here and I know it's from this.
So again, this is the great thing about art upgrades.
You can you see a clip, you think, oh, I like that clip, but is there like a different angle or
something?
It's it's great.
You can you know, you can jump in and you've got different scenes from the whole like set up.
So this is the clip that I selected for this.
I think we've all been in this position before waiting.
It looks like he's just sat there waiting in the airport and he he he's he's talking to somebody.
So let's get this clip down at to cart and let's check out and get this piece of footage.
Go to my footage.
I want this and I want it in HD.
Okay.
So like we've done before.
I'm going to wait until that download and I'm going to put it in a folder for our project.
And so here it is again in our upgrade folder, and I'm just going to grab it and drag it into footage
in Premiere Pro, like what we did with the previous one.
Because there is an element of tracking in here as well.
It's this one here.
I'm going to create a sequence from the clip.
So this obeys everything.
Again, if we've got to sequence here and sequence settings, we can see it's 3840 by 2160.
So this is 4K and good happy.
This is the clip I want to use.
It's a little bit of movement in the camera, which is great.
So we can really sell this.
And yeah, I'm happy with that.
Let's right click and replace with After Effects.
That's where we're going.
Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
That was for the previous thing.
I had to clear up some space, but.
Good.
This is where we want to be.
So firstly, now this is in after effects.
I want to get the graphics that we're going to be putting here.
And to get that, I am using motion array, but not motion array built into Premiere Pro and they don't
currently yet have a plug in that works in after effects.
But they do have a download area that is also included in this subscription.
Don't forget that we care that there's links in the the course outline where you can get to all of these.
And I've just searched for text message in presets in Adobe After Effects Presets and I've come up with
I'm looking at this 1/1 and foremost.
That looks quite good.
It looks like there's a lot of things you can do with this.
So that's great.
And so look at that.
It's okay.
Maybe I like this.
I like the look of this.
So let's download that.
As you can see, it's downloading right here in a zip file says going to be a lot more in this than
than we need just for this one thing but this is now downloading as effectively an asset.
And I have another folder on my computer on another harddrive which is titled assets.
And if I grab that and bring that over.
These are all my assets.
I have so many.
And I'm going to put this in I'm going to put this in graphics, I think.
I mean, look, there's there's a load.
But anyway, I'm going to write showing folder and then I'm going to double click this and bring that
onto the screen.
I'm going to bring up my graphics folder.
This is just purely so I know where it's it's going to be because we need to install it.
It's going to go for a new folder.
I'm going to put a text message and.
I'm going to go into here, select all of these and drag them into my text message folder.
Now, with anything that you download from for motion array, there's always a help.
I'll double click this.
There's full tutorials as to how to use it, which is brilliant.
And we also have instructions.
The instructions are important because what they do is they explain how to install them.
And that's all these kind of links here.
But it's fine.
I'll show you how to install it on this.
So here's after effects.
Here's the text message kit.
And here are all the assets.
So what we need to do is we need to go into after effects first and start this.
Okay.
What we can do, rather than opening up, we can drag this into our project area.
Which will bring in everything and if it doesn't link to your assets.
So we need to link it.
We know that we can easily come back and get this.
It's probably going to be some audio in this.
And audio doesn't always come straight from after effects to Premiere Pro purely because there's no
audio there and after effects won't create it after the fact.
But I'll show you when we get to that.
How to get the the tech the tech it's probably tech sound effects into premiere pro but one step at
a time so this is still importing it's obviously quite a large document if I go back to it.
That's right click that and got properties.
It's not too big to do 98 Mac.
So a few years ago, I mean that would be a lot, but I mean, you know, times they are changing.
So this is installing into aftereffects sometimes.
I mean, it goes like this.
I mean, my system is a very fast system, but still sometimes you could be running too much out of
program.
I'm also screen recording this as well, which isn't really going to help the graphics card, but we
just give it its own time and then we go, okay, we're in.
And this is now saying that there are certain fonts that aren't really correct.
And you heard that beat there.
That was after Adobe saying three fonts were activated.
Well, there's more fonts there, but we'll see when we get to that point.
So here's our text message kit right here.
If we double click this, we have edit, render and other as we're going to go into the edit and maybe
messages and okay, we've got we got a whole load here.
Okay.
So what we're going to do first is we're going to check that nothing has come down here.
No, it hasn't.
That's absolutely fine.
We've got conversion templates and placeholders and posts.
Good.
So we're going to be posting here.
We're just going to be messaging.
I'm going to go for four messages visible.
I've already thought about the conversation I'm going to have.
So we're going to go for messages visible.
And if I'm going to Tilde, this just so we can see exactly what the titles are, they're made really
quite, quite, quite good, actually.
And this says we've got for 3 seconds each, for 3 seconds each, ascending, descending.
And so if we just double click one of these and see how it looks.
So if we come back, this is just giving a bit time to work.
And we can see that there are things on here if I put a mouse around and just give it a little bit of
a moment.
Okay.
So we've we've also got a bit of footage in the back to kind of give us an idea.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm great.
Wasn't the band last time?
Awesome.
Yeah, it was really.
I was very impressed.
Thanks again for paying for my ticket.
I owe you.
So this is kind of giving you an idea.
This is a full conversation.
So all I want to do, really, is I want to get maybe the first four.
Yeah, let's get the first four.
So I'm going to get this staggered animation because this is obviously some form of controller for it.
And I'm going to select right at the top and I'm going to go down that.
I'm going to hold down shift and I've copied those as well, selected those controls, see to copy,
go back to our project.
I'm just going to paste them in there now.
The fact that I selected them from the top downwards is important because they then come in top downwards.
If I click on from the bottom and gone up, it would have actually started from the bottom and gone
the other way.
It's quite important in after effects.
So if we look here, that looks good.
Hey, how's it going?
Okay, that's how good.
And that's that's our conversation there.
Yeah.
Okay.
So we've got a starting a starting point, really.
If I go for staggered animation, go for position that's just reading into there.
If I I'm not going to do anything with that because that's a controller.
But what I am going to do is I'm going to create a new I'm going to create a null.
That's what this null is going to be.
I'm going to right click and rename it.
I'm going to call it text controller.
It would help if you spell controller.
Right.
Good.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to get everything other than my footage to this note.
And that is because I want to affect the movement, but I don't want to move these individually.
So I've now so I do this a little bit too correctly.
So if I those are all actually pairing to to the stagger animation.
So I'm going to do first and follows is I'm going to select all these are going to right click and going
to pre compose.
I'm going to move all attributes to that.
I'm going to title it.
Text messages.
Okay.
So if I press okay that's now opened a new pre comp didn't need to do that.
I want to go back to here and as you can see, this is effectively a nest.
Remember like the nests in Premiere Pro, that's kind of like what that is here.
And as you can see, nothing is parent to anything.
So we can grab this and we can parent the text messages to the text controller.
Why is that important?
Well, because now as we move this null around, that's scaling well done.
If I move this manual around, we can move the text messages and it would be more believable if we've
got the text messages over here.
Okay.
So if we play this back, just press zero.
Hey, how's it going?
Obviously we're skipping frames a little bit here just purely because.
Well, yeah, it's it's a little bit slow because it's trying to work out all this.
But you know what?
Let's get our conversation going fast.
They still click and say here.
And let's zoom in a little bit.
Not too much.
And let's change this text.
First and foremost, we're going to grab this and we're going to double click because we want to effect
this.
And now we're going even further down.
So as you can see, this animates in and then animates out.
That's it.
But as you can see, these are text.
So we can show them and we can show, read, read at whatever.
We're not going to do that.
We're going to say, Hey, how's it going?
And we're going to click in here and we're going to leave.
Hey, how's it going?
Because he's messaging someone to say, how are they going?
Because he's got time by.
His name's not Thomas Kova.
His name is.
We're going to call him Clark Kent.
Clark Kent, because he's actually Superman.
And people don't know.
They just didn't know he was Clark Kent.
They click out and that's now updated that we could change the time.
We're going to leave the time as it is.
So that then comes in.
Hey.
How's it going?
From Clark Kent.
And who is he messaging?
Well, who is Clark Kent's partner?
That's Lois Lane.
So we're going to go back to our text messages and.
We're going to go to the next text message, which is this next one down.
We're going to click in and we're going to double click into here and we're going to say, Well, Lois
is great, but I'm great.
Have you.
Audit yet.
Question mark this obviously is not date.
We need to click out and it's come up like that and we know that's not Chelsea.
This is Lois.
So I'm just going to say that's Lois Clark out and that's all updated.
Okay, so I'm great.
Have you boarded yet?
So if we come back to our text messages and we're going to go to the third one and Clark Kent, we know
that his name.
Clark.
I don't know if I felt like right, Kent.
I did not.
That's.
That's the house of our clock.
Okay.
Going there and delete the t clicker.
That's what they were going to say.
Flight delayed.
Stuck here again.
Click up.
Shut up.
Date.
Good.
And now we can see that struck down to the next line.
We don't want that.
So I'm going to go to here and just drag out this box a little bit.
No, we're not.
And I've spelt stock wrong.
We're going to keep here.
There we go.
I want to keep the textile, and that's how we're going to have to spell stock correctly.
That will be better.
Click out there.
That's good.
And I'm just going to move this.
I've got this highlighted, so I'm just using the arrow keys.
Are my keyboard flight delayed?
Stuck here again?
Like it's it happens all the time.
So if I come back to my text messages which are up here and this is just in the pre composition.
And play that back.
We've got our text messages coming in any time soon.
They're out.
They're down here.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm great.
Have you boarded yet?
Flight delayed, stuck here again.
He's gutted.
Absolutely gutted.
So control as.
I'm happy with that.
That's the conversation that we're going to have.
And now we step back to where we were, which was this project here.
Here's our mate and there's the text conversation.
So I mean, this looks all fine if I control that.
Go back to premiere pro and if I pre render this.
If I play this back, I mean.
That works till the base.
Looks okay.
But I want to make it that little bit more believable.
So what I'm going to do is remember this tax controller that we had.
Well, we've moved everything up here.
And this is the beauty of nulls.
We can select this text message.
Pre comp is currently being affected by the null.
But if I take that off, they stay where they're at.
They stay where we've already moved them before we took off the null.
And there's a reason for this.
Because I'm going to bring this null over.
No, not that.
I'm going to select the null and I'm going to bring this null over here.
I'm going to do something a little bit clever.
I'm going to get right to the beginning here, and we're going to track the movement of this.
Now, there's not much movement from him.
He doesn't really move at all.
But we want to kind of place this in the scene.
So what we can do is we going to track some movement of something here kind of close to him.
And I'm thinking I might track.
Somewhere around his back.
So that's what I'm going to do.
So what we do, go for tracker.
And we select the clip that we're going to be tracking and we go for track motion.
We want to track the motion of this.
And we have our familiar friend, the track point, zoom in and kind of move it over a little bit.
Spacebar, drag along.
And let's select I'm going to select this corner right here.
Why this corner?
Well, it's a definite corner.
And also it's a massively contrasting bit.
I know that that is less you going to track nice and easy.
I can see you can see that there's the contrasting colors.
Well, I find those boxes are pretty much exactly what we need them to be.
And we're going to track the position and the rotation.
And to make that easier, we get a second point.
I'm just going to grab this point and put it to a similar point over here.
I know that these two bits are always in shot, so that gives me a massively accurate track.
Don't forget, when we go into my options and I'm going to say Stop tracking after 8% just as normal.
Okay?
And then just track forward.
And this will track nice and easy.
See?
See how that just literally sticking to it is absolutely no deviation from the plan.
Little bit of movement.
DAB That's absolutely fine.
It's just between a couple of pixels and we just let that track all the way through.
They're still in frame.
And the important of this is that although the camera isn't really rotating, it may be rotating a little
bit.
This might be a little bit overkill.
We probably don't need to really track the rotation, but we will anyway just because it's an easy,
easy clip to track and it's only a 1515 second clip.
So yeah, maybe that now.
And we are done.
Now what do we do?
Well, we need to set this to go somewhere.
Just like in the Moscow stuff, where we where we created those tracking points and then we applied
those to the the placeholder.
If you haven't seen that, why you skipping ahead?
Go back to the tracking composite chapter.
I think it's the one before this one and you'll see what I mean with regards to that.
So what we need to do now is we need to feed this information somewhere.
It's okay.
It's all in here, but we want to feed it to somewhere.
Now, at this point, we will create a novel.
Or we create no before.
But we already have a no.
It's here, so we might as well use it.
And it's already called text control, which is technically what we're going to be doing with it.
So I want to edit the target and our target already comes up text controller because more often than
not the tracker is looking for a null object to push all that information to.
So going to say, okay, and then we're going to apply.
You always need to remember to hit supply.
So we click apply and we want to apply the dimension to the X in the Y.
So the x going across Y going up and down and press.
Okay.
And that has all our information.
And as you can see, it's opened up all the information here.
Don't need to be getting too bogged down with all that.
We just have that information.
But hold on.
The text messages, they're kind of still not moving with all this.
Well, what we need to do is we need to tell the text messages to follow the text controller.
And we do that.
We just either drop that down and click text controller or the much more fun way.
I got the pick whipping tool and put it onto the text controller.
You can see how that has changed there.
And now if we take it back and press zero on our number pad.
See how they're now moving with it.
I know it's only subtle.
Let me just control.
Is this an easier way for me?
That I find is if I bring it back into Premiere Pro and just give it a quick pre render in Premiere
Pro, it just helps me see everything and I think we'll do a final touch in Premiere Pro just to just
to really sell it because he is quite far away.
But let's allow that to do its thing.
Good.
Happy with that?
Let's go back.
You see how the text messages are moving with him?
It's almost like they're in the same.
And they keep on moving.
So we're going to need to get them out of that point.
I'm happy with that track.
That's good control.
And what I want to do now, actually, I'm going to do it within here and I'm going to create a new
null.
But before I do that, I am going to pre compose all of this.
So now pre compose, I don't want to open the new composition, move everything that's crackin, go.
And now we just have one thing to worry about.
And the reason I'm doing that is because I'm going to create another null.
But I could create another null, which will control all this.
But I have this.
It's effectively a nest.
So if I go scale with the s I my keyboard and then hold shift and hold p.
I can then scale up a little bit and then maybe bring him down a little bit.
That's too far.
And with that over a little bit, I'm just going to add a little bit of movement.
So I'm going to have a motion, a position and a scale keyframe there.
Now, bring that to the beginning.
You don't want to go too far because you can go way off to bring it to the beginning.
And then I'm going to scale it back a little bit.
So if we go to is 125, just going to go 110?
And if I right click a position and just reset that takes it up there and now I've got still got a little
bit of room to move, but it just lets me know where my boundaries are.
I'm just going to grab these key frames and bring them all the way to the end.
So now, as well as the natural movements in the camera, we also have a bit of movement.
We'll see what's we pre render.
And all I want to do now is I want to.
Stop.
But there.
Stuck here again.
Okay.
And what I want to do is as that starts to move up, I'm going to set a key frame on the messages,
going to press P on the position and I'm going to keyframe that and as that goes up.
It stops there, doesn't it?
So I'm actually going to help it on its way.
I moved that up.
I'm going to select these two keyframes, F9 on the keyboard to easy ease and then they're just gone
as that goes up.
That should then fly off the screen.
Done.
Happy.
Control s save that out.
Come back to our guy here, which this should now turn red again.
Because we've changed things in here again.
Because I'm screen recording it may slow it down.
There we go.
We go, red.
We just pre compose that out again.
All this is really checking that everything is fine, everything works and just everything is believable.
And the easiest way to do that is to be able to really pre render and see how it all is looking.
So, yeah, that's good.
Good, good.
Come on, hurry up.
Thank you.
Go back.
And if we tell the this, I'm playing back.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm great.
I reported.
See how it's all moving up with him.
Cool.
Now, obviously, this is shaking a little bit.
If you've got a better track and track quite well, maybe the movement wasn't really needed.
But yeah, it works.
It works.
Okay, you know what?
Let's let's find out.
I want to get that tax controller, and I'm going to get rid of that track from there so it's not moving
with it anymore.
I'm going to go and get rid of that text controller.
Come here and I'm going to track this again.
We're going to track the motion.
So it's hopefully it's overwriting the other trackers.
Okay.
So that tracker is there somewhere that controls that.
And see this tracker, if you ever get a wrong track and you don't want it, I'm just going to select
that track and press delete on the keyboard and then I'm going to track motion again.
We now have track a one again.
So tracker one, the original tracker one doesn't exist anymore.
I'm just going to come down here.
And what else do we want to track?
Are we going to track him again?
Let's track the corner of this.
This chair, this seat.
I'm happy with that.
In fact, let's get right back to the beginning of the footage that would help it just fetch the ease.
Really?
I'm happy with that position.
Forget about the rotation.
Let's track forward and see how well that does.
Well, that's moving quite well.
Sometimes with the rotation, if it's only a tiny little bit, they can kind of confused themselves.
But this looks to be tracking quite well.
Happy with that?
Little bit of jittering again, but it's really not that much.
So that should work better.
And the thing is, everything we've done up until this point isn't wasted.
All we're doing is changing the position.
Remember how we've we've animated it out and all that that that's all capped.
It's absolutely fine.
All we now want to do is we want to edit our target and we don't have a no.
So if you can't cancel that right click and go no scan.
Leave it as a no 79 and again edit target.
And now we have the option to go to No.
79 of Crazy Nulls in this project.
Press okay.
And then apply X and Y.
Happy with that.
And now let's see if that track is any better.
Bearing in mind that the starting position will be have we had the starting position at first.
So at first tax will come there.
That's good.
As you can see, we still have our text, but our null is moving around.
So we know that that has all the tracking data back.
Happy with that?
Let's just go right back to the well, close the beginning.
Kind of a what?
That may be a little bit lower.
I want to go to that position and just bring it down.
Just a little bit.
Let's see where we're at there.
Cool.
Happy with that?
So that's the point where we want to bacon and we just grab a picking tool and we pick that to the no
parentage, to the no.
Come back.
Save that.
I'm just going to go back into here now.
I'm not going to wait for that to save just two.
This is belt and braces stuff.
And I mean, as you can see, you can go as my Newt as as you like.
Really.
And.
That looks to be running.
Okay.
Let's go back to here and.
Yeah.
Come on.
It's pretty random that.
So that all works.
That's all moving with it.
It's so subtle, but it's great because it's those little subtleties that really sell an effect.
And finally, we're going to use another we're going to use the trick that we had before, and we're
going to create the final bit of this effect, which is to get this bad boy.
We're just going to duplicate this because I want it for the the data.
So we're going to right click and it's not there.
We just literally control and d to duplicate.
We're going to come down here and we're going to remove the tracker.
So this just is exactly what it is.
And we're going to go to effect bias effects marker and we're going to open marker for this.
Okay.
So we're now back in Mocha and we've got this whole.
Space to ourselves.
We're just going to track this back wall.
Now, there's very little to track about this back wall.
So let's see how well it does.
And you get our explained tile and we're going to draw just a line straight away across the back here.
We kind of want that.
I can see here that we've got a wall going straight up and that could be something that we could use.
In fact, let's undo that and let's come down from the wolf.
In fact, I'm going to go out to the wall.
Going to go from here.
I'm going to go straight along because that's probably our main horizontal and click the wall.
Go up here.
So I've got that perpendicular line going straight up and then I'm going to come across and kind of
eyeball this as best as I can.
And that's probably about a hair.
Okay, right click to close that up and let's see if we can track I'm going to track this backwards
first purely because I don't have many frames to go, don't need perspective because this is what I
was talking about in the previous one.
This is a wall that is straight on to us on a track, but backwards.
That seems to be working.
Okay.
It's it's grabbing on to that, which is great.
Little bit of movement there.
Hopefully that will hold.
I do hope that will hold.
Yeah.
It looks okay now because we tracked backwards.
We can see that this has gone blue.
So that's that's complete tracking.
We'll come back to this little green flag, have gone one frame too far and go back to that green flag
and we just going to track forwards.
And this is moving a little bit.
It's a little bit annoying, but hopefully we'll be okay.
As you can see, we didn't we didn't put up the plane because it didn't really feel we needed to.
But this looks to be doing all right.
We'll come back when this is finished tracking.
Okay, good.
So that's a little bit longer than I thought.
It worked.
But as far as now, looks like it's tracked and just scrubbing through.
Looks okay.
Let's do the little trick with the mocha logo and let's just play that and see how that looks.
Doesn't really seem to be too much movement tracking that through.
Movement away from what we want.
That's good.
Good, good, good.
Happy with that?
Control x x.
They're out.
And now what do we do?
We come down to the tracking data.
We still got this top bomb, and we want to create that track data.
Good Kong is turned on for layer two press.
Okay, that's good.
And then we right click new unsullied.
We'll leave it at that.
Right.
I like that, red.
Boom.
And then what we do is we come back to the to the clip that we have the tracking data from.
And this is medium red, solid two.
And we select our output to that and then apply the export.
And that's now up here.
And if we play it back.
I'm happy with that.
What I do want to do is want to size it up a little bit.
So let's go scale and let's go a bit bigger.
Yeah.
And now we're going to press shift paint.
So when I move it down a bit.
Now, sometimes this can really affect the tracking because we've moved around with scale.
Let's see if that kind of holds with it.
Doesn't really.
So what we have to do is we kind of need to work with what we have, which is kind of that if I move
the position off a little bit, will that be okay?
Yeah, that works.
Okay.
And as you can see, this is now behind the text messages because text messages are on top.
If I brought that to the top, it would cover the text messages.
So that's in there that it can be anywhere really.
I'm going to do is going to right click this and pre compose remember leave everything out and we're
going to say wall to wall art press.
Okay.
And now one will do is to go into this wall art instead of this, I'm going to write better text and
we're going to call this the worst.
If I could spell that.
Be good.
Worst.
Adeline.
Ever.
And click that out.
And we're going to go to my favorite thing that by the way, I cops look on there and for some reason
I don't know why, but if caps lock is on, it stops everything refreshing in after effects.
This isn't anything new.
This is something that has been around in AfterEffects forever.
So just make sure your caps lock isn't on when you don't need to be on and west well on ever.
We're going to select paragraph, we're going to put it centered, we're going to align, we're going
to center and center and then we're going to come back and we're I'm just going to size up this text
to about there.
We're going to turn off the the solid.
And if we go back to our comp.
That looks about right.
We're going to make this just a little bit more convincing.
We're going to turn on.
Okay, so that's on.
So we've got our continued rasterization there and I'm going to find our image again.
Where is our grungy concrete of move that I say this is the mistake.
What a mistake.
It's a maker and I replace that footage.
Now we are in here.
I don't know.
I had a link to maybe I'll link to it by accident.
And then we're going to bring in grungy thing again and remember what we did.
We go to track Matt and Luma.
That looks awful, which is exactly what we want.
And worst airline ever.
Just want to get back into that wall, Art, and I just want to size it up even more.
But what we want, I want it taller.
Do I like taller as well?
So if we go into the text and go for scale.
I want to size it all the way up as big as I can.
And then I'm going to unlink.
I'm going to take it a bit taller.
And we come back into here.
Now, that looks better.
And if we play that through.
I was really well.
And you see how the wall art is there right behind him.
If we want to put maybe a little bit of although you can't really see on here if we go to effects,
go to perspective, drop shadow.
If we turn back on this just so we can see there is actually a slight drop shadow here.
We take up the opacity to 100 and we move the distance.
We'll be able to see it.
And if we are only just a little bit of softness, turn back off that solid.
Come back to here and there it is right behind him.
So he's there text message in a way.
And we're pre composed, this will pre render it and we'll put it back in here and see how it plays.
And now if we play this back through, we have the tracking movement, we have the sign on the wall,
we have these texts going up and down.
You see how the opacity is slightly there.
So it looks like it's been superimposed over it.
It's being tracked to him or close to him.
So the camera is there all kind of.
Yeah, moving with that.
And also we have a slight zoom out to place him right in that spot.
That's so many different techniques once again in this one clip.


### 16. An Introduction to Rotoscoping

I'm going to show you in this section is the introduction to rotoscoping, and I will obviously once
you've seen this, I'll explain what rotoscoping is.
But just to show you what you can achieve with rotoscoping, this is just one piece of footage, but.
We can do that with it.
Yeah.
Rotoscoping.
I absolutely love it.
And it opens up a whole world of possibilities.
So to start off, we've got our footage picked out in print and I can see that there's a UHF HQ only
to get the highest quality possible, and you'll see why.
So we're going to add to Cart added to Cart, and we're going to check out what's in my footage.
And we download the HD HQ version and to save you that long, laborious thing, I won't be talking through
too much.
I'm just bringing in the footage.
We're completely used to that now, and we're going to create a new sequence from the clip.
I'm going to rename this Walking the Walk and double click or in here anyway.
And here we are.
And I love this.
First and foremost, let's just have a look at the secret settings just to confirm 30 or 40 super 4K
footage.
So that's all well and good.
And I love this footage.
It's just so beautiful.
And I love this definite line all the way through this, because this is going to be the best, the
best way to kind of show this effect, and then we'll build on that in a future section.
So with this clip, we've duplicated it.
We know how to do that alt and drag up.
We have After Effects opens, we're just going to right click and replace with After Effects.
There's our old screen from Yeah, remember that.
I'm just going to give this a bit of time to load in.
This is actually automatically saving the project from what we've talked about earlier on in the course
and how AutoSave runs sometimes.
Well, more often than not, it happens where you're doing something at the exact same time as something
else.
So what we're going to use to do this?
Well, first off, we need to do what's called rotoscoping.
And what rotoscoping is, is it's it's kind of like what we did with a mask and we say we, we, we
drew a circle around him and then we tracked him with a track mask.
It's kind of like that, but it's, it's like it's on another level.
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate in this as well because we're going to
effectively have two layers.
We're going to have a layer with just this on, and then we're going to have a layer with everything
on.
So and I select this and I'm going to control D to duplicate it.
I'm going to hide the one behind it because we don't need it for now.
I'm actually going to lock it as well, so I can't do anything with it.
And to start rotoscoping first off, and I know it might really hurt your machine, but we need to change
the quality to full.
Okay, then what we do is we come up to the rotoscoping brush, which is right here rotoscope tool and
we just click that.
And then we go into we don't go into that.
That's that's the previous.
That's fine.
There we go.
And what we want to do is we want to double click.
So we're in here.
And you see, now, when we weren't in here, we didn't have this brush.
But when we are, we do.
If I come back to here, I've got this brush, but there's no brush here.
I've got this brush selected, but it's not changed anything.
But if we coming to here, which is the next layer below, we now have this brush.
So what is this brush?
Well, this is the roto brush.
And as you can see right now, this is kind of starting to prevent.
But this is all going to change.
So first and foremost, we draw a kind of just a nice rough sketch as to what we want.
And really, I'd like to kind of roto brush him as well or her that person.
But the main thing that we're looking to rotate brush out is this front plane, this this mountain,
not that mountain.
We first need to size up this brush and it's not your scroll wheel because obviously your brush is going
up in size there, but it's actually going up in size in comparison with the whole image.
We want a bigger brush with the image the same size.
So if we hold down control and then drag up with our mouse on the left mouse button, sorry, we increase
or decrease whether up or down.
Decrease the size.
Okay, good.
So we want to just quickly mark out this bit.
So green is to keep.
And red is to reject.
So I'm just going to draw big lie down there.
And as you can see, all of a sudden, we now have a purple box or pink box that has already picked
out that for us just by drawing that one line.
So I'm going to zoom in a little bit.
Don't forget, spacebar.
You can move around.
I'm going to use my control and size this down a little bit.
And I want to include these bits of highlight.
So I'm just going to click here once and see how it does with picking that up.
Yet it's picked that up.
I'm going to click here and that's picked up maybe up here.
Oh, okay.
I'm going to push it a little bit.
Let's go all the way in here and see.
I always do mouse button.
It's like that in Photoshop controls size this down and let's see if we can pick up this figure as well.
So if I just do it, it might be a little bit small.
But okay, that's us.
But we don't want the legs.
It might not really matter.
But for for accuracy, I'm just going to draw a little bit over here.
It's not showing up, but it will it will read it.
It's just it's really close.
We're right into the pixels here and it's starting to kind of work its way along and that's ruined net.
So that's control and that to remove that.
And this is the thing with voter brush.
It's brilliant, but sometimes it tries to be too clever, so I'm just going to undo that.
You never want to kind of deselect where selected because it's almost like you're telling it to learn.
Okay, I wanted a bit of that, but I don't want this.
So okay, controls that has worked.
And you know what?
For the sake of this.
Yeah, I don't know.
We're not going to bother.
We'll be a little bit more more technical in in future.
But let's just see what we're doing now.
So if you can see here, this is the Roto Brush and refine edge, kind of what did it call it, span.
Okay.
So what we now want to do is we've fed in this information.
Let's click forward just maybe a little bit, just here and now it's doing is it's propagating.
So it's moving along these frames and it's trying to track that.
And as you saw, if you can adjust, seeing that as it moved, it's kept that shape.
So going I click forward a little bit more and let that see if it can kind of track that again.
And yeah, it's done it quite well.
It's quite a definite shape though, which is quite good.
And although you don't see as this green bar is moving along, it's working through all of the frames.
I'm just going to click a way along and let's see, there's 92 frames there.
Let's see how well that does.
Just fast forward a little bit and as you can see, this is just gone off screen just for fun.
Thanks for that.
But this is starting to propagate all the way through.
The thing is, this is big, big footage.
So it kind of needs the time to go through.
And that's what rotor brushing is doing.
It's actually starting to propagate further on than where we're at.
And it's lost a little bit here.
You just need to give it a bit of time and work through.
But I'm going to kind of push it.
I'm going to come all the way over because I'm actually really quite confident that the rotor brush
will be able to track this quite easily.
This is using this is rotor brush, too.
This is technically called this is using Adobe sensei.
And it just it just gets better and better as as they develop it.
And again, this is a point to be made for the subscription service.
You'd wait to maybe once a year, maybe once, 18 months for a new update, and you'd have to upgrade
and pay rise with this.
This is a manageable monthly payment that you get used to and you get the new stuff as soon as it's
available.
You can also opt into beta and get the stuff that isn't quite available because it's not like completely
finished.
But you kind of get the tools ahead of time to start playing with them.
And yeah, I will come back when this is finished.
I'll make a note.
It's quarter past the hour now.
Let's see how long this takes.
Okay, so we look to be making some kind of headway.
We've lost it back here, but we know it did actually put it in here at some point.
Now, this is also this could be down to the cash in the round that you have available in your computer.
Just going to check off screen with regards to my cash and I've got loads, I have an absolute load.
But yeah, what you should do best practice is you should allow the grain to completely fell all the
way up.
However, generally you don't really use rotor brush for such a long clip.
Maybe that's where my mistake was.
But I want all of this.
I want it all.
Show.
That's a song.
And as you can see, the brush is kind of keeping it is keeping there and it's keeping it off what I
want it to do, really.
So let's just let it do this one last pass.
And I'll, I think I think we'll have enough to get the effect that we want to get.
Yeah, it's teasing me now.
So here's the propagation coming up to where I've actually selected.
And it's actually ahead of me because it's running these this Chevron blue bar as we've just come to
the play head and we'll just check how the actual selection is going still.
I mean, it's still very, very accurate.
There's little bits, but I mean, that doesn't really bother me.
So I'm just going to grab my play head.
I'm going to put it right to the end here and then let it go all the way through and then we'll go to
the next step.
Okay, so that took a little bit longer than I thought it would.
However, right at the end and the majority has this green bar.
Ideally, you want this screen bar running all the way through to confirm that it's checked everything.
But I'm confident, so I'm not going to click back.
What you do at this point, when you're happy with how the rotor brush has done, we click frees and
this takes a bit of time.
What it's doing is it's now working through each and every one of the frames of which there are 784
of them and it's just freezing that.
So you can't do anything about it.
And this is new actually with Rotor Brush two, it actually plays through and shows you.
So you can kind of keep an eye on it where as you can see, we're only 1% here.
So we are going to speed this up.
However, as you can see, this is still colour and behind is black and white.
So it's kind of it's showing you just by saturation what's being cut out.
And as you can see down here, rather than a green bar, we're going to be getting a kind of a blue
violet bar.
And what that will will show once we get to the end is that that is absolutely, completely frozen.
By the way, the freeze is got nothing to do with the actual footage, although I would imagine it's
quite cold up there.
But yeah, let's come back once this has completely finished.
Now, I do think the screen recording has kind of like a slow this down quite a bit and it looks like
it's going to crash.
However, this is getting towards the end now.
So I am confident, he says, that it's going to complete and it did.
Good, good, good.
Happy with that AutoSave project?
Yes.
Do that.
Do that.
Nice and quickly.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, good, good.
We're back.
Okay, so I'm going to control that as well, just to save it myself.
I know that's going to take a little bit longer, but I said we start this is about quarter past the
hour.
It's now 22 the next hour.
So yeah, nearly half an hour to rotoscope, all that, which is what this is doing with the rotor brush.
So that's done.
So we're not going to step out of this layer, all that frozen.
And you see how that is now cut out.
Remember, we did this other one down here at the bottom, so we've now got these two.
Okay, so if we track this through a little bit further, we've got him there.
Good.
Now we don't need this bottom one.
And why is that?
Well, that's because we have it here.
Yeah, you get in with me.
Are you kind of understanding why I always duplicate?
Because it gives us options.
And if we were to do everything in here and then bring it back to Premiere Pro, we'd have to render
out everything, including the Backplate.
We're not going to need to do that because we've got it here.
So what do we do now?
Well, we can do a couple of things.
We can bring our text here or we could bring our text on premiere.
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to bring it out in Premiere.
Am I?
Yeah, because I'm going to use premiere composer for this.
And although I can use it in in after effects here I have the text I kind of need anyway.
Here, it's actually going to be an effects that I can put on to it rather than actually bring in the
text.
And if I just tilde out here for a second, if I I'm going to close back up and if I'm going to go to
start pack because this is in the free starter pack and we've got text presets.
And if I click on that, it shows everything here.
And.
Yeah, that's good.
Good.
And I want something actually coming in from the side, does it not?
Yeah.
There we go.
So if I go right, it comes in from the right and then goes off to the left.
Cool.
That's what I want.
So I'm going to add that effect.
And that will be just going to do it for the length of it.
And we have the text that will come on through there.
Okay.
So I'm going to change this text to walk the walk.
And I change this to maybe like a gray ice gray switch stands out as good.
And of course, we can.
Oh, I like that.
Where did that come from?
Authority.
That's quite nice.
I like this in primary composer because it gives you a decent sized sample of what the text is.
If a go to essential graphics and I mean here because it's it's technically the same if I scroll down
and I scroll down there's my my fonts here but it only gives you a small little sample here to the side,
whereas in primary composer it gives you it nice and big.
So if I come here, I'm a sucker for both of you, to be honest with you quite like that.
But I don't think that really fits where we're going here.
So we're going to go for maybe Castella?
No.
Yeah, I could be quite classic, actually.
And there we are.
We have the text in here coming in.
Walk the walk.
Now, I want it to be kind of just maybe, maybe scaled down a little bit because I want it to be just
the other side of here.
As you can see, if I maybe pre render half of this in and out there just to kind of get the animation
coming in, you can see that it's actually coming over the the actual plate.
It comes just straight in from the right hand side.
And that's kind of not what we want.
What we want it to do is to come in from behind here.
And that's taking a while to right there.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to drag that above.
So we kind of know where we're at.
And as you can see here.
You see how it comes from behind?
Play that.
Walk the walk.
I think to be more impressive is actually a thicker, thicker font.
So let's keep going.
Not necessarily.
Oh, Chandler, I like Chandler, but that's not right for this at all.
Chuck probably isn't right for this either.
Let me find one that I like.
I like.
Well, yeah, that's good.
That's good.
Let me come back here.
Let's see how that looks now.
That thing comes from behind, but maybe it doesn't show it enough.
I want motion blur on and if I go for my animation.
I want I want it to kind of come comes in the bit too quickly.
I'm going to leave the thing because I want to show you that we can actually do that.
And here but I'm actually going to go back with my original thought and I'm actually going to place
it on AfterEffects and I'll show you why.
Because in here we've got so many more options with regard to the text animation.
I'm just going to toggle off my transparency grid so I can actually see this.
And if I come into again, it's Start a presets and I've got transitions for text and I'm going to do
characters.
And as you can see here, we have loads.
I'm just going to tell you this, you can see and we have quite a lot of things we can do with this.
I'm actually going to animate words.
And I want them coming up fight to shut that down position.
That's not the way I want.
Uh, those ones.
Not the one.
That's the one I want.
I don't want it.
Yeah, kind of.
Is that that one?
The one.
This is the one I want.
So what?
It's called walk the walk.
And I'm animating words.
It does the words individually.
However, we can't really do anything with this yet because rather than dragging it on, we need to
apply it to a text layer.
Okay.
So what was that?
Let me just undo that.
What was that?
Was that copper?
Is that copper something?
Yeah.
Okay.
So we create a text layer just like we would in in in premiere pro, and we just click in here to create
our tax layer and we're just going to type walk the walk.
It doesn't normally take this long to catch up, but there's a lot running on the computer at the moment
and highlighted it all.
I'm just going to make it black so we can actually see it and I'm actually going to wait all the way
out.
Yeah, we are.
It's just big text and size that down.
That's actually it's no wester.
No no wonder I like it.
I'm going to keep it as no, I don't care.
And I've used that a lot, but I don't care.
I like it.
And we're going to have walk the walk here.
Okay, so that's good.
That works for me.
And we're now going to apply.
The this one bottom saw it come in.
So I want to animate it in.
I'm also going to animate it out.
So I'm going to have animate in.
Animate out.
I'm going to select both.
But before I do that, I'm going to check whether I kind of want it to come out.
I'm going to leave it in for about 16 seconds.
And so to do that, I'm going to bring back this clip because it will put a tail on the end.
I'll show you why this is selected now for bottom.
I'm going to hit both with this layer selected here.
Both and it's done.
So how that will work is like this.
Walk the walk.
Good.
Happy with that?
Good.
However, it doesn't start far enough away from me.
So what I want I'm going to do is I'm going to have this selected and I'm just going to drag it off
further off the screen.
So that's one five, six, seven.
I'm also going to go out to the same position.
So I'm going to click this in control and say, Click in here Control and V.
So I know it's going to go out to the same place, and I think that comes in a little bit quick.
That's why I wanted to come in here as well, because you see this right here.
This is what's been created by an animation composer.
And we can drag in this to make that in transition take a little bit longer.
Like that.
And then might have a little bit shorter.
Yeah.
Maybe just 10 seconds will have over 10 seconds.
And the reason why I shorten this at first is because once you shorten this.
The tail out stays there.
So you've got to move that as well as trying to save myself a click but didn't really need to control
that just I control so often just to be on the safe side especially in after effects because after effects
because there's so much going on in after effects it can it's easy it crashes easier than premiere pro.
So finally, the only couple of things I need to do is I'm going to drag this below this top layer and
I'm also going to turn on motion blur.
In fact, it's turned on crack.
And this is the motion blur effect just to make sure that there's some blur once we're moving.
All right.
So as we're clicking that through.
Benobserver it's not about much.
Is that is that really give me motion blur.
Let me just check that again.
There we are.
Now we've got motion blur to toggle it on and off.
And that goes like that.
So if I now control is there again, I know it's a habit, but the thing is, if this auto saves, once
you're back in premiere pro whatever you've pre-rendered quite often gets overwritten.
So it doesn't it doesn't go to green in premiere pro.
It just goes back to red again.
You've got to pre render it.
So as I walk the walk we don't want this anymore going to bring this down here just so it's nice and
tidy, going to hit out there in there and pre-rendered this and see how it looks and so plan this back
now that is pre-rendered.
I got that.
Looks good, doesn't it?
And what we're going to do, finally, is we're going to use this bottom plate again, just to be just
reassured that this is the bottom plate right behind.
And we're just going to use the fact that we've got this separate just a little bit more.
And to do that, we're going to go to Effects and we're going to apply a glossy M Blur.
We've used this before, going to drag that onto this bottle clip.
And just as the text starts to come in, I'm going to blur it out.
The background and watch the back here as we track that up.
We blur out just a little not too much blur out there.
Going to repeat the edges.
I was going to.
Walk the walk.
Why not?
And the last thing I'm going to do is I'm actually going to offset this walk, the walk just a little
because I wanted to do one other little thing.
And that is.
That one.
It's just like that's what I'm going to do, is just going to offset this text a little bit too about
there.
So that's when I want it to come in.
She was about to us to say 2 seconds.
Yeah, 124 frames.
Okay, I'll save that again.
Paranoid.
I'm going to come to 2 seconds and that should now disappear because it should be out at this point.
And I'm going to grab both of these.
I'm going to nest it.
While this is just catching up, I'm going to say final work.
It's okay.
And we've now nested this clip.
Reason why I want it to nest this clip is because I'm now going to hit a scale position right here.
And I'm also going to hit a position right here.
Scale, position, scale, keyframe.
It didn't feel right when I said it.
A mammoth.
And I'm going to zoom in.
Of it, he says little bit too here.
Okay.
And I'm going to drag these.
And if I tilted this out, I'm just going to drag them just a little bit.
Okay.
Right, click those and hit it out and then going to drag along a little bit.
And that's has that text is coming in.
You can see it just there.
I'm going to reset that and reset that.
So that resets everything back to where it was.
And as a keyframes, I'm going to ease in.
Til the blackout.
And if I play this back now, I might have to offset the text a little bit more, but.
Yeah.
Let's just offset the tax just a little bit more and I want to drag out this fade out, just this zoom
out still a little bit more as well so children with their play that back.
I'm going to tell the this we can see in full.
I love it when it starts skipping frames.
It's so much fun.
Let me pre render this.
But we don't need to prevent it all.
It's just.
What?
When is it in?
By Paul Machine.
I've done a number of chapters today, and I think my machine is just about to say to me, Adam, please,
I want a night off.
I don't blame expenses for that.
We've been doing a lot in After Effects.
I've done probably about the last two or three chapters today in the same day, and my poor computer
just wants a little bit of a lie down.
I think I want a little bit of a lie down as well.
I just need to explain this moment and just say, I really hope you're enjoying this.
Well, I hope if you're enjoying this course half as much as I'm enjoying making it, then you'll be
really enjoying it because I'm I'm having a ball making this this course.
And I hope you feel like I've set you up for at least success, if not a career.
Because everything that I have shown you so far and I will show you for the rest of this course.
I use a lot in my day to day working in this industry.
So full but good.
Let's play this back.
And.
It's good that because it establishes at him, establishes him, establishes this walker.
I didn't know ossietzky.
So I then we continue off.
Allocate.
That took a bit of time, but a lot of it was waiting around, waiting for the machine to do it.
And that's the beauty of rotoscoping.
We're going to we're going to go into a little bit more rotoscoping next in the next section and how
to fine tune certain things and make everything work, such as like hair, which is notoriously difficult
to kee out.
But we'll be looking at that next.
But I'm going to let this computer have a little lie down for now.


### 17. Using Track Mattes

In this chapter, we're going to be looking at tracking mats and how they differ to other kind of masking.
And with tracking mats, you can achieve something like this, which may not look like much, but there's
a lot going on in the background and setting up a and after effects composition like this can really
step up your abilities of the effects that you can then apply to.
Future compositions and track mats are so important to play with.
We've played with them in the past when we used a Luma mat, when we put the projection up on the wall
when we were in that tracking composite.
But this is going to take it.
Well, we're not now taking it a step further, but what we're doing is we're looking deeper into the
track mats.
Okay.
So this there's a lot more going on with this than first meets the eye.
And I'm I'm showing you this now because this technique is going to be used in the next section.
And rather than building all in in that section, I want this to stand apart mainly, not only because
I want you to get the knowledge now, but also this may be useful when you're coming back to this,
if you're trying to refresh your memory about a certain technique of this technique.
So that's why I'm doing this now as well.
So it's and it's an easy way to refer back to and to do this.
I've got this image.
You send this image already.
This is actually the walkway in the airport in Seoul.
And I'm trying to ignore the fact that it's not level.
But yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to play with that right now.
So I've just got a 1/2 to shoot it a little bit longer.
Yeah, let's do a 5/2.
I probably won't use all 5 seconds, but 5/2 image file and we're just going to duplicate this.
I'm going to open it in after effects.
Now I don't have previous after effects animation open because I wanted to take this time to show you
if you're starting from scratch and it's actually brand new and you haven't got any aftereffects thing
up, this is how you do it.
So the minute that you bring something into after effects, it will ask you to save it.
Just like when you're when you're starting up a new project and it asks you where you want to save it
and all that same in here.
So we're just going to call this.
This is just the next one.
So I'm just going to put course names to just so I've got something.
So the image is in here and the image is 5 seconds, as you can see, and nothing is happening with
this image.
And what we want to do is we want to kind of split it.
But if you think back to what I showed you at the beginning of this, I can't refer back to it because
it hasn't been done yet.
I record that at the end and then put it back, put it at the beginning.
As for all, we create exactly what you see rather than me making it, doing it, and then trying to
to redo it again.
So what is happening is we're not cutting open from the middle.
We're growing out from the middle.
And there's a that's kind of where the difference lies.
I'm just going to zoom out a little bit.
So we've got some room to move because we're going to be working kind of outside or like inside of this.
But I want to come out to to show you so I'm going to tell my title Safe Action Grid Thing because that's
purely because I want to see what percent of markets and what this effect is.
It's a series of of masks.
So I could duplicate this either side what I'm going to do but I'm actually going to do it all on the
left.
So it kind of you can see how the two differ.
And I kind of sounds like I'm speaking in code, but I promise, promise it will become clear so we
can we need to draw a mask.
We need to a shape on here to make it a mask.
So I'm selecting everything.
So I'm not touching this.
If I left it selected and even there's a number of ways we can do it.
But if I grabbed this shape and started doing that, you see how it's it's making a mask.
And while that kind of seems like the right thing to do, it's not because this is masked on this shape.
And now if I start moving it, it it will all move together, you see.
And what we want to do is we don't want to mask out this part of this image.
We want to mask out on do it and do we want to mask out this part of the composition so then this image
can move inside it.
So what we want to do straight off the bat, as I said, there's a couple of ways to do it.
We could click out and grab a rectangle tool for going to scope them and we could set our film.
Just going to leave it as red.
But if you want to change your fill, you can pick your color like this.
You can also add a.
The stroke.
We've got the stroke turned off right now.
But if you want to add a stroke, you can add the different stroke options here, but we can leave it
with no stroke.
And all we're going to do is we're going to draw a box which kind of comes into the center.
Now, that looks pretty much center and.
Well, yeah, it kind of is well done.
That never happens.
Of course it isn't.
But the easy way to do this that I found is to undo that.
And if we double click here, it will create a shape right here, which is the size of the whole the
whole composition.
And then all I do with my my pointer tool here is I size this down, but I want to size this down to
the left hand side.
And if I start to grab a handle, it starts doing it from the center.
And why is that?
Well, that's because our anchor point is in the center.
So if I undo that turn away, it's not kept it there.
But remember, anchor, point mover, you can do this manually by grabbing this and dragging around
and and like kind of like clicking that.
And now you need to grab it.
And this will show you how long it's been since I've done it like this way, because it's just so much
easier if we just get animation composer.
It's brilliant and it's free.
You can, you can get add on things to it, but just get it.
It's free link in the course outline and we got to anchor point move up and let's just drag that down
and I'm going to go back to a selection tool.
And with this selected I just click left middle and you see how that's moved straight up to there.
Why have I wanted to do that?
Well, because I want to size it down from the left.
So if we go to our scale properties, which with this highlighted, if we press s, it brings up our
scale properties and we want to unlink the boundaries because obviously if we start sizing down, it
keeps the same aspect ratio and we only actually want to bring in along the x axis from the side, not
the top.
So undo that.
And if we unlink that is it this one I saw this and so we can kind of drag it down and that works it
kind of snapback seem to that might be a new feature but the easy way to do it, as we can see, is
all the way across there is 100%.
So we just need to go into here and type 50.
Boom.
Done.
Good.
That isn't it.
So that's our sheet player.
Okay.
And we're going to duplicate this by control and D and I'm just going to hide this and lock it just
so we can't touch it.
We still have this shape layer right here.
So what are we doing now?
Well, we want to also duplicate the image behind us again.
Don't ask.
Don't worry, I'm just duplicating it.
Let's not talk about it right now.
Let's just hide it and lock it.
Okay, so now nothing has changed.
We can see that now we have this shape player.
And what we want to do is we want to use this shape player to cut out this image, but only in this
area.
This is why this technique is different to a mask, because what we're using is what's called a track
mat.
And as you can see down here, tr k if you can't see this, you just need to toggle on some of these.
I think it's that one.
No it's not.
Is it that one.
No it's not.
Is it that one.
Yeah it's that one.
So is this one down here expand or collapse the transfer controls pane.
And what we do is we want to effect this clip, but this clip needs to be directly below the shape.
So we're going to move this up and we're going to play with these.
Okay.
So it's just these two.
You see the top sheet layer is hidden and locked.
The bottom image layer is hidden and locked.
When you click onto it, it kind of does a little flashy to say, no, you shall not pass bit of a Gandalf.
So we come across to track mats and there are two options.
There's, there's Luma mat.
When we use Luma mat before, well we're going to be using a track mat or an alpha mat.
And what we want to do is we want to say alpha mat shape player.
We don't want to invert it yet.
We're going to use invert the other side.
So we want to alpha mat and click that and now we've cut out like we did before.
But notice the difference if I play around with the position now because the sheet layer is still there,
it's just hidden because it's working as a tracking mat for this.
If I move this image.
Yeah.
You get what I'm saying?
Okay.
So with that, that's distracting main content to AFL.
And so that's kind of the start of what we want to do.
Okay, so that's that side.
So let's do the other side.
So I'm going to unlock this image, unlock the other shape, and I'm going to bring up this image and
I'm going to add the I'm going to hide that image first.
The bottom one, I'm going to lock these two just so we can't touch it.
Okay.
I'm going to reveal these two again and we're back to where we started.
However, now we're going to use the inversion.
So just like the other one with the normal alpha track.
Matt We tracked or matted the space that the shape is in this way we're going to do the opposite.
So we're going to, we're going to track anything that the shape isn't in, so we're going to invert
it.
So with the image, you always do this on the image and thankfully with with a shape it used to be there,
but thankfully they hide it now.
So you can't get confused.
But we're going to with the image dropdown an alpha inverted map and just hit that and now we've got
the right hand side.
Okay.
We've not touched the images.
The images haven't been cropped.
And if I come back to here and press P, you can see that the image is all still there.
So now what do we do?
Well, we create the animation.
We unlock these too.
We don't move the image, this image.
Oh, because this image is reading from that shape layer and this image is reading from this shape layer,
which is turned both turned into tracking mats.
So we turn on the image.
So we've now got a full image again.
Good.
And get rid of the, the proportions.
Now we're going to get rid of the proportion grid and the title and I already did, I was seeing it.
So now we're going to keyframe these two halves of an image which don't look like two halves of an image,
do they?
They look like a full image because they're two halves next to each other.
And that's the beauty of using the 50% and getting it absolutely bang out.
Okay.
So this image is the right and this image is the left.
So we're just going to rename that.
We're going to say right click out, click in and right click and rename and hit left.
So now we know what we're doing.
So the right needs to come to the left, and the left needs to come to the right.
So we're going to keyframe this.
But just like we've done in the effects controls in Premiere Pro before, we're going to move ahead
a little bit because I'm going to move to like say 2 seconds and this is where I want it to finish.
So I'm going to hit a you see on the positions.
If we don't have them here, let's just close everything up.
We want the positions on both the right and the left.
So both images.
So I'm going to select both by selecting one control and click and select another.
Just like in your Windows Explorer or in Finder, we click the first one hold down shift and click the
bottom one, and that selects everything in between.
We use Control and click the first one to hold down control and click the left.
So this is now multiple select.
And what we want to do is we want to hold down the position keyframe and just hits a keyframe there.
So we've now created a keyframe right here.
Okay.
So now we're going to bring the play head back to the beginning, and now we're going to bring the right
to the left.
And the easiest way to do this is to grab this handle here and just start dragging it to the left just
a little bit.
We just want it right there.
Okay, so now that's hidden behind this image.
However, it's not because it's only reading where that tracking mat was.
So when we actually hide the left, there's nothing there.
Okay.
Although you can see the outline right here of the blue outline.
That's where the image is.
But it's tracking mat because it's inverted.
It says, I can only see it when it's over here.
So now let's show that image again.
And we're going to move the left over to the right and see how it works exactly the same.
So we're going to place that, just that.
And that's a key framed.
So that's the start of the keyframe if I play that through.
See how they move out.
I know it doesn't look impressive, but this effect will help us in our next our next step.
And you'll use this.
I promise you, if you like this technique, if you like the way in which it can manipulate footage
and graphics and everything, you'll use this a lot.
We're just going to now make these keyframes just a little bit.
I dunno, more natural because this is a linear, a linear keyframe.
You see how it just starts and stops.
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to highlight these keyframes.
Remember, if you can't see them and you want to see everything that's actually key framed, select
everything and hit you on your keyboard that will bring up all keyframes in everything.
Similarly, if you only want a certain keyframe of of one layer, you just like that one layer and hit
you.
So we're going to highlight these keyframes by dragging a marquee so they all turn blue.
And the easiest way to start keyframe in these is to hit F9 on your keyboard and watch these.
That turns into easy ease.
Okay, so if I show you that now as easy ease.
See how it's just a little bit more natural.
It starts kind of slow.
It's like a bell curve.
And then finishes slow.
We track this low.
If we track these two, just select these two and drag them out.
We can make that movement a little bit longer.
Good.
Now, one of my favorite ways to ease is to use the speed ramp.
And that's this guy right here.
It's in the graph editor.
So what we want to do is, well, the highlights.
All of them, again.
And just with them highlighted, we're going to hit this graph editor.
Now, this is our speed ramp for the keyframes.
If yours doesn't look like this, just drop this down and hit at it speed graph and it will show it
like this.
Sometimes it shows it far too big or far too small.
And what we're going to do is we're going to drag and highlight that.
And what that's effectively doing is highlighting just these two key frames.
You see how it's holding up these two.
So with these highlighted, we're going to grab this handle and we're just going to drag it, keep it
out on the same line and drag it to the left.
So now we've got this, rather than if I controls that, we've got this, which is what I said.
It was a bell curve.
If I control shift Z to redo, we have this, which means it's going to speed up quickly and then start
to fall off its speed earlier on in the trend in the animation.
So if I slow not Tilde, if I come out of this and take it back to the beginning and play, you should
see a difference.
See how towards the end it really slowed down.
And that technique, I promise you, will be so useful not only in this next section that we're going
to do, but in a lot of things that you do from here on in whenever you're playing in aftereffects.


### 18. Advanced Rotoscoping

So in this section, we're going to take rotoscoping to kind of the next level.
Remember in this chapter where we were rotoscoping, this from the edge of the mountain?
Well, we're going to take that that kind of idea.
We're going to mix that with this track mass idea, which we had here.
And we're going to create something like this.
Oh, and we're going to be tracking to all in once we're building up all of our techniques so we can
create something like this again from just a single piece of footage.
All that coming up right now.
So to start off this, we need to start, of course, a new sequence.
But we're not going to do it this way.
We're going to do it like we've done previously.
And that is with the actual footage dictating the size of it, because we can always outputting 1080
if we wish to, but because we're rotoscoping, we kind of want every single little bit.
And as I can see, we can actually have 6k0 because this was done on the red epic track.
And you know what?
Let's play with some six k footage.
That's going to be scary.
Is it that clip I wanted saw that clip.
I'm going to have this clip, actually.
So let's add that to CART and I'm going to I want this clip just just because of the composition of
it.
And we're going to check out and got my footage and oh, God, let's play with some square footage.
Now, if you're watching this in the future, like years in the future and you think six K is nothing.
Yeah, it's quite a bit to me right now, but we'll see.
So I'm going to just off camera, I'm going to add.
Cut that and I'm going to paste that into our our folder, that one, and let's just bring this across
so I'm not being rude into video B-roll art.
Great.
I'm just going to paste that into there and then I'm going to come into here and just put it in footage
for now.
Good.
I'm going to right click this and we're going to new sequence from clip.
Okay, so there's our footage.
And.
Yeah.
Looks good.
Lovely.
Colour's a mess.
I really like the.
I really like how it's been shot.
I'm just going to close all these.
So we've got a little bit more screen and.
Yeah.
Okay.
If that's six K and a hundred there, what is our sequence settings.
1496 by 2106.
Remember that 1920 by 1080 is what we've been working in.
We're like, Yeah, we're quite a bit bigger, but it's exactly the same.
Just going to alt and drag it up and right click and replace with after effects composition.
So now we're in after effects.
What we're going to do is, as you saw, we had the text coming from behind to, okay, so we're going
to build up first.
I'm going to build that and I want to build that in here because we've got a different aspect ratio.
If I go to composition and composition settings, yeah, we're actually at a ratio of like 24.
But yeah, yeah, it's kind of like a cinematic ratio.
It probably looks good, actually.
This would look good horizontal on on a mobile phone because they're they're slightly taller than 1920.
So that probably will display quite well on a phone.
So we're going to use this composition to make our text.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take this clip for now.
I'm going to press t on my keyboard to bring down the opacity for no other reason.
I just I just don't want it distracting.
I'm going to lock it.
Okay, so now let's make our text, which is says be here and you here and it moves out.
So we're just going to click in here and just type B, you okay?
And as you can see, it's created a graphic layer and it's done it for the full length of the composition.
Unlike in Premiere Pro, if I click and click in here and start a text, it only does it for a certain
amount of time on do that it does it in after effects for the whole duration, right.
So let's get back into this text kind of highlights it all and over in paragraph we're going to set
that to center.
But I always do that in the wrong, wrong way because we need to go to a line first and in composition
we want it centered.
Oh, it didn't bother me.
That's absolutely fine.
As you can see, because it's so small, the anchor point is really standing out.
So I'm actually going to make sure that that is properly centered as well.
And just here, I'm going to go a line vertically as well, so that in the center we might move this
depending on how it sits, but this is our starting bit, just going to size this up a little bit.
Be you, okay?
Happy with that?
And I'm just going to postpone the keyboard and just kind of bring it down a little bit.
Now, it's not it's not too much of a worry that the Y is directly in front of us all technically,
then be directly behind it, because we can always play around with this and we could obviously click
in here and it's a spacebar, but it brings that out and yeah, it's fine.
I don't really want to bother with that, but I'm happy with this graph, this text graphic.
If you didn't want to then change it, you could then right click this and create shapes from the text,
which is all well and good, but I can't then change the actual the font because it's now an outline
and a graphic.
It's a vector graphic rather than text.
So why would you ever do this?
Well, a graphic vector graphic will raster is better.
You see how down here we've clicked on this in the past and it's continuously rust, right?
It works better when there's shapes.
So if you do want to do this, it might be better to do that towards the end when we know where we're
at.
So I'm just going to undo that.
And just like we did with the image, remember in this composition and we split the image or we duplicated
the image, does what we're going to do with our text.
Okay?
So we're going to select it and we're going to control and D So we've just made two versions and I'm
just going to rename these.
I'm going to put I'm going to call this you.
And I'm going to right click and call this B because B, that layer, although it's both the words I
won't be to be the left hand side and that's why I'm going to bother about on this layer.
Similarly with you, I want that on the right hand side and that's all I'm going to worry about in this
line.
That makes sense.
Okay.
I also have a feeling that I'm also going to want to move this out a little bit and I'm moving B, but
I'm looking at the, you know, but I also might want to size them up.
In fact, straight off the bat I am going to size them up.
So got them both and just.
Bring them over there a little bit.
I might also bring B through.
In fact, now that they're not back, I don't really like I don't really like the font.
Can we try a different font?
See how.
Sorry, I didn't make that clear.
If I just had one selected and change the font, obviously one would change and one wouldn't.
But if I select them both, I can change the font like this.
So I'm just going to scroll down.
I want something chunkier, chunky, but I'm trying to avoid no west because I know we've used that
a lot.
And maybe something maybe.
Actually, maybe something handwritten.
I've done handwritten in the past.
Let me have a look.
I you know, I quite like this.
The Chandler 42.
I kind of got into it quite recently.
It doesn't really work for that, though, you know, it's like a it's like an old fashioned typewriter
and how the the print looks, you know, it looks good.
Yeah.
You already know what I've picked because you'll have seen the the preview, but.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm happy with that.
Be you.
So what do we do now?
Well, I'm actually going to hide you, and I'm going to use P and I'm going to take this text.
I'm just going to delete it because I don't want it anymore.
I've changed my mind, and I'm going to move that just.
Just they're just they're just so it's like kind of on her shoulder and to do the same with you going
to hate that, bring that back and click in here and delete that.
And I move that out here, but I'm not going to turn on B so I can see what it's doing and let's try
that out.
And I like that bear because that's actually going to be behind her head and it's being able to put
text in between layers that don't actually exist.
If I unlock this and bring back up the opacity.
They're going to be sitting behind her but in front of the background, which really sells it.
And that's what kind of sells this whole effect, really.
So now that we've got that done, I'm going to go to make a shape.
So remember what we did before kick offs and nothing is selected and we're just going to double click
here and then we're going to align remember going to align the anchor point to the left and then press
s on the keyboard unlink and we're going to bring this back to not that 250.
Okay.
And you know what we're doing now, we're going to drag this over here and we're going to label it this
time.
We're going to say B, Matt.
Okay.
And just while we're at it, want to duplicate this kind of bring it across above you.
I'm going to rename this as.
You, Matt.
Okay.
Just going to hide that you, Matt, for now and actually hide you.
And just like we did before in the track, Matt, we're going to select Track Matt and say Alpha Matt.
So now shows B, okay.
And we're just going to hide.
I'm not gonna hide anything.
Going to bring up you and bring up the you might be a little bit lucky.
And we still got that bag.
We don't need to move on, Matt.
We just select are you below?
And we select Alpha Inverted.
And now we have them on different levels.
And remember what we did before.
I'm just going to go forward a few frames.
Remember going forward them back.
Yeah.
Along forward and back.
Yeah.
Frames in after effects is not with your cursor, it's with page or from page down.
So one is one frame.
If I hold down shift, it will go five frames or five, ten, 15.
And where now.
Actually, that's more that's much more than five, ten, 15 frames.
How many does that do.
Ten frames.
Sorry.
Yeah.
It's five frames in.
Can I wish they had a universal system.
Five frames in premiere pro.
And you hold on shift.
It's ten frames at a time when you do it in after effects.
So I've got these two.
I'm going to select you and control select B and just add a keyframe to both of these.
And I want that leaving there and then going to shift and page down, page down, page down, page down.
So that's what 30 frames.
And set another key frame with these because I've got them both selected when I select set one keyframe,
they both have the keyframe selected.
So I'm going to use this and go back to the beginning.
And the last thing we need to check before we start moving these is that we make sure that both our
mats are invisible.
Okay.
I must have accidentally clicked that, but whenever a match is active, it needs to be invisible.
The reason why is because if I start moving this you when it's invisible, it can't be seen.
However, when it's seen, it actually prints its color on there, which actually could be quite useful
for an effect.
But we don't.
We don't want to take this.
So let's move this all the way off and just look in the edge of the view here.
And we're going to.
Bring that just about there.
Good.
Happy with that?
And then with the baby going to just go the opposite way.
Keep on dragging on.
Why doesn't that work?
Well, that's because when I turned this on this mat, it kind of affected everything.
So actually, we're just going to say no track map for this.
Just going to bring it back.
And then alfamart.
I'm bringing like that again.
It doesn't look like anything has changed, but as I start dragging that off.
Yeah, I hope that makes sense.
Just sometimes these things can change themselves, and then we're just going to do that.
Okay, then we're just going to highlight both of these key frames.
Easy's them and play that back.
Good.
Now rather than easy if you want to kind of speed up that graph a little bit.
So sorry, I'm going so fast.
And so we highlight both of these.
We don't have to, but it just helps if there's more keyframes and it just says this graph, these are
the ones I want to zoom in on and I hit the speed graph, highlight this one at the end and just drag
it up.
Sometimes you can go up or down here.
We never want to do that.
I've never found a reason why I want to do that.
I've checked that all the way to the side.
And the reason why these are slightly different is because each of these is is traveling a slightly
different length, a different journey.
However, they they both start and end at the same time.
Okay.
Hope that makes sense.
I'll play that back.
Boom.
Be you good.
Happy with that?
And now all we need to do is be able to place them behind our talent.
Now this becomes the fun part.
So control us.
And what I will do is I'm going to take this track.
I'm actually going to hide everything here.
But remember that we only turn on what we want to turn on.
Must remember that.
And we're going to duplicate this track as well.
So shift control and D to duplicate.
We're going to hide this back and just lock it and then we're going to bring this right to the top.
Okay.
Because this is the bit where we're going to actually rotoscope her our talent out of this scene.
So with this selected, we're going to click on our Roto Brush and then just double click.
So we're in right in here.
Okay, good.
Now remember what we do.
So we're going to get right to the beginning and we're going to hold down control and drag up with our
left mouse button to start painting our talent.
So the easiest one is easiest area is the torso.
So just draw a line down here and this will start.
Good.
That picked up a lot.
Just need to draw here and that will pick up her.
Good.
I'm just going to tell you this to make it a little bit bigger because we want to kind of see everything
and you see how it's picked out the the building in the background, which is kind of the similar color
to the shirt that she's wearing.
So we want to get rid of this.
So an alt which turns it to a minus and we just draw a little bit here, let go and good.
That's bringing in maybe a little bit more.
That's a little bit too much.
You never want to undo, though, simply that you do want to undo if you've selected something incorrectly.
Well, I've told this system now is that I don't want this and then it's brought it back here.
And rather than undo and try again, we want to tell.
I still don't want the bit that I actually paint it here, but I do want here.
So we leave it as green and just drag here again.
And now it's made it up.
If you undid and tried again, you could be repeating that process a lot.
So now let's move up to the difficult areas.
I'm just going to zoom in with one click, hold down my spacebar and drag with my left mouse button
and we're now going to get in her face.
I'm just going to draw a small line through there.
Okay.
We're now getting parts of the face.
It's auto picking up a lot of the face.
And now what we've we've bounced out to the hair.
Okay.
So now is the time where we really need to fine tune this.
Okay?
And the way to do this is back up here with the rotor brush.
If we long press with the left mouse button, we go to refine edge tool.
Right now, you can see that our brush has turned blue.
And what we want to do is we want to refine the edge.
We want to refine where the hair is.
That's the most important.
So all we do is we match them where the edge of our hair is and we just start to draw.
But as you can see, as I draw, it's blue and there's a reason for that.
And I'll show you once I let go of the mouse button.
So I'm just.
Just carefully going all the way around the edge, just staying out, not going too much into where
we're trying to scope out, by the way, either don't get too close to the shoulders either.
So I'm just going to come here and let go.
And what this is now going to do is it's going to try and work out where the edges and as you can see,
it's picked up round here and it's turned into an alpha channel.
Okay.
And what that technically is doing is it's saying, right, there's going to be really fine detail here,
which we need to watch out for, not just a definite edge like here, but there's going to be fine detail.
Now, as I said, I didn't want to get too close to the shoulders and just going to zoom in here a little
bit more spacebar and dragging with the left mouse button.
And I'm just going to do a little blob here.
Just click right there and see if that matches up.
Okay.
I'm happy with that.
It's also a little bit through the hair here, so I'm just going to click here.
And happy with that.
It's recognizing that I'm just going to size down my mouse and I'm just going to click a little there.
Little doubt there.
And a couple of little dots just here.
It may pick it up, it may not.
And for this effect, it doesn't necessarily have to be like really accurate, but as accurate as we
can get that be great and okay.
I'm happy with that.
We've got a little bit high up with the edge there.
So what we want to do is in a control command control and left mouse button, size it up and just like
with with the other tool, the main brush, if I hold down alt to minus, I can kind of say, well,
actually, no, we don't quite need all this.
This isn't the edge, this is actually the background.
And we can just refine this and you see how it's now coming back off.
And it's all about kind of adding and subtracting to this rotoscope to kind of give it as much information
as possible without spending too much time.
Again, this is another thing that same like Hollywood, one person will be tasked to do one scene and
we'll go frame by frame and probably spend about six months doing what, like aa5 minute sequence if
5 minutes, maybe in 30 seconds.
So I'm kind of okay with that.
But remember, this is only one frame, so we're going to Tilda out of here and I'm going to go back
to our main brush tool.
I'm going to fit so we can see everything.
And as we've come here, I'm just going to click a little bit along and this will start propagating.
So just in here and we'll just leave it propagate.
It's only three frames, but let's see how we're getting on.
That seems to be holding.
Okay.
We can check this with these little sets down here.
So if you click this first one to toggle the alpha channel, that will show is just white and black.
This is a Photoshop kind of clipping mask effect.
So black is taken out, white is capped.
You can also tag along to see different areas.
So this is kind of like a hotspot which once is called Alpha Boundary.
So it kind of gives the bleeding as well.
You see how that's like that.
What we don't want if we zoom in a little bit.
We don't want round here.
So I'm not going to go back to the Refine Edge tool.
I'm just going to come with our normal brush to hold down Alt and just call it.
Yet.
We don't really need any of this.
That's the background.
And just kind of we just update that seems to have done a little bit if I'm going through a finance
tool.
You see how we don't have the black halo around it now, but you can see all the purple bits in the
strands of her hair.
I love this tool.
I really do, which is going to say, no, this is not the edge.
We're a little bit too far away from the edge.
That was with the alt key health and you see how that is now brought back into her.
Got a definite edge here which is obviously the background.
So again, we're going to alt and drag with or paint almost with our left mouse button and that's close
that up.
Good.
And I just want to right mouse button hold on control size this down a little bit by clicking drag in
the left mouse button and we're just going to say, no, that is not our edge.
And.
Oh, come on, please behave.
Just maybe a couple of times to go.
No, this is definitely not what we want.
This is definitely not what we want.
Okay, maybe.
Oh, that's the ad still going back in there, but it's actually the brush that has picked this up because
it's yeah, it's it's the definite line coming up from here.
So we just kind of say, nope, that's how we want God.
So that's close right up to our head again.
And as you can see, the propagation has started to move along.
So let's click along a little bit further and see how that does.
Okay.
This looks to be kind of opening itself.
Let me just go to fit, because the problem is, is when you're concentrating on one area, quite often
other areas kind of lose out.
And for our purposes, I think we're doing okay here.
Let's click all the way up and see how this does as a propagating.
Good.
We're still obeying.
There's very little movements.
That's fine.
These little bits of hair, they're not too bad.
That's fine.
I'm okay with that.
Let's click a bit further along.
Let's see how this does and just say, you know, it's not going as fast as this.
I am speeding up in the edit to save your sanity.
This seems to really be holding onto her.
So I'm going to get a little bit cocky and I'm going to click like even somewhere like here.
And let's see how well that goes.
It's now 28 minutes past the hour.
I'll let you know how this acts, how long this actually takes.
Okay.
So that actually only took about 2 minutes.
And my system is really quite fast that this can take quite a long time.
But the effects, I think the effect is definitely worth it.
And yeah, okay, fine with that.
Let's come up a little bit.
Good and happy going along.
Everything seems to be tracking.
Okay, we've got a little bit up here, but I'm alright with that.
Good.
Happy with that.
I'm going to, I'm going to take it right to the end and let go.
And let's just finish up this bit of propagating.
As you can see, it's really held and it's kind of why I selected a little bit about this footage because
the white really contrast against everything else apart from this little thing, which as you can see,
it's kind of held up like a champ.
And Sensei Adobe Sensei has said, okay, yeah, I get it.
This is definitely not part of the subject that you're trying to isolate.
So that's all well and good.
But I want I picked this, this talent because I love her hair and I need to be quite a bit of detail
in her hair.
So I wanted to kind of show that refine edge.
So good.
We've got our clean bar all the way up.
Everything looks good.
The little green balls on top is actually quite pre-rendered itself as well as well as the propagating
for the the rotor brush tool.
But we're just going to click Freeze now, which takes another while and will come back once each one
of these have been frozen.
But as you can see, and I only speed this up, I won't cut it out.
But as you can see, this now goes through and it stands out a little bit more now that we've desaturated
back.
I like the way it does that and it brings back this this alpha channel around here so we can see exactly
what it's doing.
Okay.
So we are frozen out.
Everything's good.
So we come back to our project and she's gone.
Why is it that that's gone?
So we now have her there.
And if we unlock the bottom, we bring back the background.
But just let's keep the background back for now, and let's just play that through.
As you can see, it takes a little bit of time because it needs to prevent us from zero on the keyboard.
And you can see that there are certain points here and we could go in and we could get these minutely
taken out for I'm quite happy with it.
It serves its purpose for us.
And if I bring a little bit into through where the text will be, it would help if I turn them on.
Remember, we bring on the text, not the maps.
And it's coming out.
That looks good.
Right.
I'm just going to pre-rendered this so we can see it properly.
Bring that back.
And just zero on the keyboard.
I'll be back when we're pre-rendered and just.
You know me, I bring it back into Premiere Pro because it just prefer to pre render in here.
And if we play that back.
Good.
It looks good, however, because there's still this movement.
I've got my textile stuff because there's this movement in the camera.
We've got all that moving around and I kind of want to stabilize the lettering, so let's have back
into our after effects.
And that's correct.
That and the way in which we do that, by the way, to make it easier because obviously we have all
this, but we have the duplicate.
I actually didn't export the background with aftereffects.
We don't need it.
It's already in here.
So let me go back into AfterEffects and let's turn this on for now and let's hide everything else because
we don't need it.
That was just the text.
So they're not going to be there.
And what I want to do is I want to track something around here on this wall.
I think in quite possibly the colony here might be a good track, but it is out of focus, so that might
make it a little bit difficult.
But because we've got the contrasting, yeah, it might help us.
So first and foremost, I'm going to go new and know because this is what we're going to have add the
tracking to.
I'm going to set that center and just center, align it just so it's there.
Just I'm going to leave it as No.
One.
That's fine.
So what we're going to be tracking going to be tracking in here to go to our tracker and track motion.
And now we're in here again because this is the same place where we had our rotor brush, but that's
all frozen, so that's all fine.
Just going to grab this 22.
Yeah.
Do you need to zoom in?
Controls that.
Just grab this here and it's going to bring this round.
And let's move over to this corner.
See how it's even looked rounded by the time we get here.
I would love something a little bit sharper, but could be.
Could we track her color?
It's all going to be kind of the same.
But no, I want to track the background because it be moving slightly differently.
I'm also looking at this CCTV camera here, but let's see how well this does.
So, yeah, good, good.
I'm going to track I'm just going to track the position and we're going to track it backwards because
we're a little bit in.
So let's track backwards before we do.
Don't forget options.
Stop tracking if it's below 80.
I'm just going to open up this just a little bit and maybe this open up just a little bit and the track
will take a little bit longer, but we should get a more accurate track.
Track that backwards.
Seems to be sticking with OC.
Good.
Happy with that?
As you can see, our motion tracking has started for you so we can actually see them composite here
and click back to the previous one and then we're just going to track forward.
And that seems to be doing a good job.
Yeah.
I'm happy with that movement.
Oh, good.
And sticking with it.
Okay.
Good.
Happy with that.
So, yeah.
Good, good, good at it.
Target motion target is.
No it's already said it's going to be.
No but let's just double check.
Yeah.
Happy with that and apply and say yes X and Y.
Good.
So all the information is there in that note.
So let's get to a point where we're happy with where the text is.
We need to turn on the text again, that one and that one that's bring the text all the way out first.
Happy with that there.
And what I will do is I'm going to go from B and all the way up to the U mat.
So all of those I'm going to right click I'm going to pre compose those because those that we have movement
key framed in here and we can't be affecting that because it would just affect everything.
So we're going to move all attributes yet.
Don't want to open the new thing.
We're just going to say call this text comp and hit.
Okay.
Boom.
Good.
We now have all this tax within this pre comp and if we turn her on, remember she wasn't on at the
moment.
So she's there and I'm now going to pick up this text, come up to the no.
So that movement now.
See how the words now move with it.
Happy with that.
Good.
It's not showing that, but it is going to hide that background control and s.
What I'm actually going to do with this text.
I'm going to add a drop shadow.
I could do it within it, but I'm just going to do it outside it and I just go to effects and stylized.
It's nice perspective, isn't it.
Yeah.
Perspective drop shadow.
That brings a little drop shadow here.
Bring all the way to 100% maybe distance it off a little bit and really.
Give it some softness.
And when I bring back that background, you'll see it just it pops just a little bit where it needs
to.
You know, the lighter parts just stands out a bit.
So say that, in fact, hide that and save that.
Come back to our premiere pro and just pre-rendered that out again and let's see how it looks.
And so in our pre-rendered out, let's play it back.
Alex cry.
Really happy with that.
At.
Completely tracked and we brought our talent off the background so we can put text behind to put anything
behind.
And now you could put even a different background if you wanted to.
I mean, well, we could even if we bring these up now and we could create a new climate and we could
maybe pick maybe that blue are quite like that blue.
It's okay to drop back down.
And put that right behind her.
Disable this background.
And all of a sudden you have.
A dark background or a color background?
If we pray, we enter that which should take a lot be a lot quicker because we don't have the six k
footage behind her as well.
Make a life of me and take over 2 minutes.
I'll come back 2 minutes later and play that back and yeah, okay, we have a little bit around here
and we could we could go back.
Can we find their spot?
I mean, seriously, for the first pass.
Such great love.


### 19. Introduction to Greenscreen

In this section.
We're going to show you how to take a piece of footage like this which has been shot in front of a green
screen and just in a few clicks give you this.
And then take it even further.
Your introduction to green screen.
So I've got to be completely honest, I can't believe I've got this far into the course and not discussed
Chroma Key or what used to be called Chroma Key.
It's now just a fact, affectionately known as green screening, which is what you can see behind our
talent here.
This isn't a piece of stock footage.
This is actually a piece from a shoot I've done at a client's purely because I couldn't find any green
screen stuff.
Because why would you?
Because most stock footage doesn't really have anyone speaking, because that's kind of not what you're
doing it for.
So I had to give some from my own archive, and this was shot at a client's place.
And what we wanted was our talent, our presenter, to be on a blank background that we could use and
we could animate with if we needed to.
So this is the shots.
And to explain what we're looking for with green screen is we're looking for a well lit talent, which
is what we have.
We have the flights over on here.
We have a nice bit of shadow coming across the face here.
I'm actually just going to close out these because we don't need these at all if it's at least just
not right now.
And this was quite well-lit.
We're lighting our talent, but most importantly is the green screen has to be well-lit as well, because
what you're trying to avoid is hotspots and shadows.
And we weren't 100% successful with that just because of the places that we could put the lights.
This background actually has three lights shining on it from off of shot.
And as you can see right here is this is our big soft box lighting, our talent.
But I knew it didn't really matter that this was in shot because this wasn't going to be in the final
composite because, again, that's what this is going to be.
It's going to be a composite.
So let's start.
Well, first and foremost, we we shot.
So we knew that our talent wasn't going to move.
And as you can see, our talent stays right pretty much in the center of the screen, a little bit off
to the side, but that's absolutely fine.
So first and foremost, what we need to do is we need to just get the color right first.
So what we do is we go to our color and I shot this in Sydney too with the Leeming lot settings and
that's just to make it easy for me.
So my quick creative corrective lit is Sydney to boom of sun.
We've got more colours.
Good.
Happy with that?
What I will do is I'll add a little bit of contrast and as you can see this, if I toggle this off and
on the green as I close that the green really pops, which is exactly kind of what we want to give us
a little bit more room.
I'm going to lift the shadows ever so slightly, which should bring these shadows up is going to affect
our talent as well.
But, you know, you're kind of you're marrying off the two.
Happy with that?
Go down to creative.
I'm just going to sharpen it so slightly.
I have sharpening turned off in camera so I bring in it's it's my workflow and it makes our videos just
pop up a little bit more.
Good.
Happy with that?
So we know that we only need but we only want the section where our talent is.
But we don't need anything off the side here.
As you can see, this is being shot in a work environment.
So first off, we mask out.
So use opacity, mask and all we want.
I just want to draw a free buzzer.
So I use the pen tool.
Just going to drop this down to maybe 50% yet.
Just to give me some room on the outside.
Remember, we touched on that in a previous section.
I'm just going to go up here.
Down here.
It's just a crude box all the way around.
Boom, boom, and done.
So now we have just that.
That's all we want.
We're not going to feather this because we don't want to feather all the way in or anything.
Just we're actually going to take that 200 feather as if we can off.
You can see it's a definite line all the way through and that's the start of what we're trying to do,
then come out of colour back into editing and good by the way, I've clicked into editing but these
remember we normally have like motion of premiere composer in here, but the last time, the last time
I had Adam editing open, I'd only deleted them.
If we want them back, don't forget right click and reset to saved layout.
But this is how I want for now.
So now what we want to do is we want to bring on a keying out effect.
And that's why it used to be called chroma key and it used to be blue.
And the reason why it's green now is because people have started.
Wearing blue.
Actually, our talent has like a dark blue on here, but this lime green is very rarely in clothing.
And like I touched on previous, when we're looking at I think there was a shot.
I was in both effects by effects mocha and they had a blue screen, I think it was Robyn Green.
It's because there was green in the scene and they knew that ahead of time.
So they brought the blue rather than the green.
But green works for us and I just make sure that all of our talent are told that yet we don't want any
green.
Please avoid any green.
Now we could rotoscope this, we could take this into after effects are rotoscope.
But as you've seen, that takes up quite a bit of time.
And the green screening, the keying system in Premiere Pro has come on in leaps and bounds in recent
years.
So it works so much better.
And the important with the importance with having a blank green is you can see here we've got space
in between the arms which we need to keep out as well.
So what green screening effectively is doing is you're selecting a color and saying ignore that color,
take it off, turn it to an alpha channel, so make it see through.
So that's what we're going to do effectively making the rest of the green acts like the rest of this
mask.
So open opener effects.
We go into our search bar and we type for Ultra and we want the ultra key effect.
So we got this and we tracked this onto our video clip and nothing has happened yet.
What we want is to check and pick the color.
Now, what what is highly advised is that you pick the green as close to your talent as you can.
And it doesn't always have to be like, say, if our talent moves around and say we pick somewhere around
here and she moves ahead, that's okay.
It's not always picking from that pixel, it's just picking that color.
So we pick our key color and I just get so my close, I'm going to get down here near the shadows and
just pick that.
And I mean that's doing a decent job already.
And Moat, well all that green is gone.
You can see there's a little bit of white here, but that's I mean we can work with that.
The white this left there is like that the lighter part of the green that is still there for our output.
We're going to if we check it over, you can see our Alpha channel which will show you remember white
is kept black, it is rejected and here are just certain parts of gray.
So those are brought in to the percentage that they are gray, if that makes sense.
So all we need to do is if we go to a color shown, you can see also puts a different color on where
the green is.
I never find that helpful because I can't see the nuance in here.
So let me go back to Alpha Channel for now and we just going to scroll down a little bit and play around
to see if we can clean up this.
And the beauty of having the Alpha Channel is that we can see that definite line around our talent.
So if we start playing with, say, the tolerance, take the tolerance up a little bit, you can see
how much that's affecting, which is absolutely nothing apart from a little bit down here.
So we'll start out the pedestal now that makes the difference.
So we take that pedestal and we track that up just a little bit.
So it's gone here.
It's still a little bit here.
If I then take the tolerance up of that, get rid of the rest of it.
Not really.
As I said, this is a little bit a little bit of trial and error.
Let's take the pedestal all the way up until that's gone, which is there.
Let me just check that back a little bit and watching the numbers here as well and work on 40.
Okay.
55, let's switch back from the Alpha Channel and see how that's looking.
Looking pretty good to me.
That's looking.
Okay.
And if we drag through with our talent.
It looks like it's done.
I mean, seriously, how easy is that?
So we can check in as in a few ways how well it has actually done because we're looking on black and
yolk.
It does look spot on, but let's be absolutely certain.
So let's go on to here and let's just create a column that, in fact, I don't have to there's a white
mark right there.
Let's drag that in, drag back behind our talent.
And.
Yeah, okay.
That looks pretty good to me.
Now what?
I want to check if I just come back to Olczyk and just took off.
I just saw this little bit of lightness here in her hair, and I didn't know if there was a bit of spill
from the green.
Not that it could do it because it was behind her, but now that's not taken.
Now you see how the hair here, we're getting rid of a little bit of a hair, which isn't really too
much of a problem.
But if we go into spill suppression and play around with this spill.
We can we can try and get a little bit about her, but we don't want to change things.
Matt Clean up, maybe again, this is a lot of play.
Sometimes the spell suppression will help you see how this choke a choke here is pulling in that that
key.
So if we change from that, the choke to soften and I want to kind of soften it just a little bit.
And then with our midpoint, obviously, if you take things all the way, you can see how much they
have an effect.
But that doesn't actually seem to be doing anything.
I don't remember this being as easy to keep out as as it was the first time, but it seems to be absolutely
working great.
And how does do we feel with regards to well, we don't want to turn her like a an alien, but the saturation
is 100% hue is absolutely zero because we don't need to color correct.
Because we color correct before.
And actually, I'm I'm more than happy with that.
Again, if you need to make those little changes, let's just play this through and see how it's working.
And yeah, we look okay.
What's, what's drawing my eye?
If I zoom in a bit, say maybe to a 200%, what's drawing my eye?
Is this here?
But it's actually the back of her hair.
And actually, if we look a little bit closer now, we can see that there are certain parts she's going
to pre render this just to absolutely double check if I'm saying set the out points at the end and control
and enter, we can absolutely double check because this seems to be a little bit of artifacting actually
on the clothing if I drag that through.
Yeah, we don't like that.
Yeah.
Okay, so this is where we really start.
Stop playing with the spill suppression.
And obviously if we drag this up, we still got it.
We still have that spill suppression.
We still have those that artifacting there.
We don't want that because it just it takes down the quality.
So I'm going to undo that spill and we're going to kill off the softening.
Yeah, the softening is what's doing it.
I want to maybe boost the contrast.
There we go.
So that's that guy.
And if I undo our tilde, so this is undone.
If I control shift and Z bring it back up, that's gone.
And yeah, that looks much cleaner now.
So that was because I was too soft on the mat cleanup.
Again, I didn't need to be soft because the key had been so good in the first place.
So that's our talent kit out.
Now, what could we do with this?
Well, we could do a lot because if I we set saved layouts.
So we've got our our little tools up here.
If I say, okay, the but I'm just gonna put lab trying spell laboratory, I'm going to look for lab
in here and.
Okay, that doesn't quite work for me.
Uh.
No.
I want, like, a background of a lab.
You know what?
If in doubt, let's say I was looking for green screen all the way through this, and I couldn't find
anything.
But let's get into art grid and let's go to a science lab.
Okay.
We look very similar.
People we want.
We don't want any people.
This is the beauty of this as well.
It's so handy.
We don't any movement either.
So I'll shut up.
We're going to say interior.
Obviously we want a tripod, so hopefully that will just lock it off.
And how does that look?
There's absolutely no movement there at all, though.
I mean, that might as well just be an image.
If I look at the rest of the story of this.
So that's moving.
That movie.
Is that moving now?
That's not all it is a bit.
It is a bit of movement.
Okay.
But well, we'll go off.
We'll go for just what looks like an image.
But we're going to.
Yeah, we'll make this work.
Cool.
So add that to my basket.
Oh, my cart.
Sorry.
Checkout.
Go for that and download that in 4K.
And I'm just going to grab that lab footage and bring it into footage.
And double click.
Come on.
Double click laboratory.
I'm going to bring that in.
Good.
That works for me.
Now you can see how this was shot at a slightly different size.
If I sometimes this sets it set to frame size now that doesn't work.
So we just need to scale it up a little bit just so the top and bottom is all good.
Good.
Happy with that?
And then we're going to grab our talent and put our talent above, get rid of this white mat and let's
bring that down now because this is a static shot really of the lab.
We can duplicate this.
We can just hold down alt and drag to the side rather than up track to the side.
And we can make that all one off and starting off.
Okay, that looks good.
We're all right.
However, it looks like a background doesn't it doesn't look like she's actually there.
So first off, what we're going to do is we're in a place there to the side just a little bit.
Rule of thirds is always, you know, love a rule of third don't rule thirds.
Look that up because that's important.
And what we can do to make this kind of believable.
I'm just going to nest these two clips below.
So if we choose to effect this, we can affect them both together.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a adjustment layer, an adjustment layer.
So and remember what the adjustment layer did, it kind of affected everything below it and the drop
down.
Put that over the top.
If I go to color, if I now start affecting the color on this adjustment layer, it will affect both
of these.
So if I go to basic correction and just maybe no, I don't want to change exposure, actually, let's
bring up the contrast just a little bit.
Shadows maybe bring them down a little bit.
And if I add a little bit of sharpening now, I don't I'm shopping.
Let's maybe take down the saturation a little bit, bring up the vibrance.
That kind of is starting to kind of feel right.
If I just toggle this on and off is the zero, see how we're starting to bring them in with the same
levels of contrast and all that we can kind of replacing them in the same kind of area.
Obviously this we didn't light off talent with this in mind.
This was just an afterthought.
And if you do, if you are thinking of doing this kind of have a look at the footage that you've got.
First is kind of see where the lights are because looking at these lights, these lights will be going
all the way along here.
Or we could imagine that they are.
So maybe a top light would be good to kind of give that effect, maybe a little bit more lights on here,
which will be bouncing off the side of this wall onto our talent.
Maybe if we take off talent and lift up the shadows a bit more.
That kind of yeah, that brings it into a little bit more believability.
Now, the final thing that I would do personally with regards to this footage to make it look that little
bit more believable is if you know any kind of rules of photography or videography, you'll know about
depth of field.
And while this is out of focus, this is in focus.
And the thing is, you couldn't it's not possible with one lens and one camera to have a talent in focus,
this out of focus and then further back have something else in focus and those little kind of things.
Your average user, the average user, your average viewer would not necessarily pick up on, but they're
like, Oh, something doesn't really feel right, but they don't know what doesn't feel right.
So going to use a friend Gaussian blur in the effects drag that and put that onto our background.
Now we don't need a lot of this.
We really don't need a lot of s in fact.
No, we put it on the wrong thing.
We'll put it on her.
Yeah, we do.
We're going to put it on the bottom layer.
So this is the nest and we don't need much, just the tiniest little bit just to kind of help sell it,
see how we're just blurring that out.
I mean, if I went all the way up, I mean, would be like, what's the point?
But if we blurred out just ever so slightly and there we have.
Pretty believable Chroma keying out of a talent which originally if I go back here, put this up here,
actually, and that's just going to reset everything.
That was at 50.
I'm going to turn off the opacity mask, turn off limit you color turn off ultra key.
That was our original.
If I put fade on there just with a few clicks and with the footage actually planned out ahead with the
lighting and getting the green screen exactly how you want it, you can go from that to this.
And as you can see, everything looks absolutely spot on.
And as she moves her arm.
Look at her.
Her right arm, left arm towards as you move it out.
You see how you can still see the image behind and it's the little things like that rather than a bit
of artifacting of green or going all a little bit noisy.
It's those little things that will help.
The I believe what it's being shown.
So that is green screening.


### 20. The Double Exposure Effect

Okay.
So there's a lot in this.
So I've I've already opened up and you've been called double exposure.
If I just go up here, you can see there's a pen and I floated in the two tracks, one being the Golden
Gate Bridge right here and another being this fella I've actually I've come to changed my mind as to
what's footage I wanted.
I used him first and I decided to go for him.
And the beauty of being able to do that in Art Grip is that I came back and this wasn't here this time.
I came back here and I thought, I want some.
I want to see what other angles I have for this.
And the beauty of art.
Great.
Is that more often not you have views story right here.
If I look on here, all of the footage that we've got.
Yeah, we can see this icon here, here and here.
Yeah.
And even here.
Yeah.
So you can easily just go into view story and see all the other footage that was shot as part of that
collection.
And this guy isn't actually as alone as he seems in the footage that we've got because he's got his
lovely little dog, the Jack Russell, I think.
So.
That's the beauty of of grit.
Don't forget link in the course outline for this and everything that we talk whether it be premiere
composer motion array all of that there are links in there and some of them are free and not to overthink
the putting, but some of them you get a discount if you if you go through that link.
I always try and find good deals.
So yeah, you're welcome.
So we've got these two pieces of footage.
What we want to do is we're going to create a sequence from this footage rather than control and, and,
and starting up a new sequence because we want to as big as possible.
I mean, if respectful of how we're going to render out, we're going to work with as much room as we
can.
So with that in mind, we need to create a sequence that's with the smallest piece of footage.
So if we mouse over these, we can see that this clip here, which is currently in our source monitor,
is 3840 by 21 six.
So keeping that in mind, let's just mouse off the other one.
And that is quite a day, 1496.
Okay.
So this is the larger clip.
So we're going to go with the smaller clip purely because the bigger clip is better sizing down to the
smaller clip rather than the smaller clip sizing up just better for quality.
So we're going to select this clip here and right click and we're going to create a new sequence from
clip and it loads in that piece of footage.
Gretchen Happy with that?
I'm just going to rename this.
This sequence is just double exposure.
Okay.
If I click on name to refine.
Good, we've got them all together.
So it just it's nice if my I were then going to grab this other clip which is the Golden Gate Bridge
and drag this in and then pretty much the same length actually, which is great.
However, we want this on the bottom.
So just going to grab that guy, put him up, select them both and drag them to the bottom.
Just going to press down on the keyboard.
Wants to go to the end of this clip.
If we want to include this one, which we do, we just turn on V2 as well and click up and that goes
to the end of that clip.
What we want to do is want to trim the end of this clip to be the same.
So with with this highlighted and w on the keyboard that just trims the end.
Is it funny how we're doing these things now?
Nice and quickly now that we just understand the shortcuts and it's these little things that really
do help speed up everything.
Okay, so what we're going to do?
Well, first and foremost, we're going to select the two of them and we're going to right click and
we're going to replace with after effects composition.
And now we're in after effects composition.
Bearing in mind I opened this up before so we didn't get any kind of error message.
We're just going to go to fit so we can see everything, maybe zoom out just a little bit.
That's a little bit too much fat up.
Leave it there.
And what we're going to do first is going to rotoscope this fella out.
Now, you can do this with a static image.
However, I've chosen to do it with a video first because I think it's more impressive.
And secondly, because the things that we do for video is pretty much the same for an image.
Whereas if we use an image, there'll be less things that you do.
So this one kind of covers both.
Really, the only thing that you need to know with regards to an image is you'd either take that image
and convert it in Photoshop with a transparent background, or you can actually rotoscope a single image
in here as well.
So you can actually apply the same principles that we're going be doing in here to a single image.
So speaking of rotoscoping, let's get on with that.
But one thing before we do, I know that my my system is getting a little bit false.
So I think this is a good time to show you what to do if you're it's one thing to to help when you're
working after effects because after effects takes up quite a lot of cash space.
So to clear it out, you hit edit.
Anywhere.
Even if you're not in a project, you come down to purge and all memory and disk cache.
And yeah, I've currently got a disk cache of 41 gigabytes and so press okay and just let that run through
that it does it quite quickly spice through the it and after effects the premiere pro version is edit
preferences down to media cache.
And what this does is it brings up a dialog box.
Is it much slower not to show why but my midi cache files on a second.
Internal harddrive is just it's the best way to speed up your system and I just press delete delete
unused media cache files done.
And what that will do is it will delete any kind of cash caches builds up in the background to allow
everything to be able to reference be referenced quickly.
And that cache in this respect is is just we're deleting everything that's not being used.
So everything that's not in this project, that's why I understand it.
Anyway, my cache management also automatically deletes the oldest when it exceeds 30 gigabytes.
Some people, I think by default it's on 30 days here.
But we don't want that.
We, we have it as just it doesn't delete anything like source files.
It's just the cache that's built up in the background so that the software can access it easier.
It's just as simple as that.
Good.
So let's do that and let's go back to After Effects and let's get right to the beginning of this clip.
Just going to hide the clip behind for now and we're going to start rotoscoping this out.
So to do that, let's double click to go into the actual layer of it and let's go to our rotoscoping
tool.
I do love this tool.
It's to size up a little bit.
Don't forget, it's controlling your keyboard and just drag up and down and then let's break it down
a little bit and let's just draw a little bit here on his torso.
I see.
Good.
Let's pick that out.
It's picked out that as well, which we don't want.
So all in down the alt key, just going to take that little bit and hopefully get a little bit more.
Just a little dot there.
A little bit more of a dot.
It's because it's a similar color, you see.
We know now because we've had that we need to keep an eye on that as we step forward.
Okay.
Let's maybe size down the brush a little bit and get the rest of his shirt on this side.
Good.
That's good.
Little bit more down here, maybe.
Good.
We're not fully out of the woods yet.
Let's just scroll in and move around a bit.
Don't forget, scroll up or down on your mouse and hold down spacebar to move it around for the handful.
And just going to try and refine this a little bit.
Got just want that bit that bit.
Since he's so good for this.
Just going to click there, see how it's just it's an auto selection tool.
It uses very similar tool than what is actually in Photoshop and has been in Photoshop for a long time,
which is the quick selection tool.
Getting there.
We're going to feather this a little bit.
So it's not absolutely crucial.
But at the same time, I do want to start off with the best intents.
Good.
Okay.
I'm happy with that.
And now let's get to his face.
And as you can see, there's hair all the way around here.
So we're going to have to refine those edges, but let's just draw a line through his head first and
foremost.
That's done quite well, hasn't it?
It really has done quite well.
And yeah, I'm quite happy with that.
So what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that Adobe knows that all this is edges and has
and all that kind of stuff.
So we're going to long press and select over to refine edge tool, which is going to size down this
a little bit because we don't need that much and we're just going to slowly trace the edge of his head,
trying to keep the the cross on the on the brush.
Almost all the way along the line.
Well, we may come back for those has just passed.
And I'm going to go I'm actually going to follow where his head would be or the majority of his hair.
And then we'll come back for these and just do that just through.
They're going to go up into here and down and out hair.
Let go of that.
Let it do its thing.
Remember, it creates an alpha channel here so it can the white it can see is being kept, the black
is being rejected.
Remember what we what we had before because the alpha channels I'm just going to click in once here
with the scroll wheel.
I'm just going to get these hairs here because little things like this is what's going to sell it.
It's just up here, just up here.
And these are the kind of things that you need to kind of watch out for.
You see how this selection is all the way up.
That's block selection.
So the parts between the has those will be caps as well.
And we kind of want to refine that.
So let's go all the way through this and just paint it all and see how the selection picks up.
And that's what we want to see.
Want to see the hair turning white and what's not hair being black going to come out here and just get
this little bit here as well.
Happy with that, I think.
Yeah, good.
Click out once on the mouse and the mouse scroll wheel and we just going to get his eyebrows and his
eyelashes and that was the wrong thing to press.
Now, rather than going out and taking that out, which we do want to undo that because we we want to
say not forget that we don't even want you to consider that that is a block that we want to keep.
It's just come in here, control to size down and let's just get that bit of hair there.
And.
These eyelashes got quite long.
Eyelashes as any good.
That's all going white.
That's what I want to see.
I'm just going to find this edge actually around his skin because as he turns his head, we may get
more facial hair.
Can I stop there for now and then I've got to reposition.
Good.
Again, we're looking for the white and the black, because that's the alpha channel.
So I'm just going to come through here and a full where his mouth would be.
And then I'm going to come back here, try and like pick up some of these has.
I go that that kind of rent and that out good that's looking right I'm happy with that that's where
we get some of these has.
Around here you probably been able to tell now that this is the reason why this footage as well because
we've got hair and hair it's just not notoriously difficult or has been in the past to keep out of anything
good happy with that?
Let's just go to fit.
So we've got everything in the center.
I'm happy with that.
So I'm just going to go back to our rotor brush tool.
I'm not going to click forward just a few frames to see how that does as it propagates through and builds
up that picture.
Again, don't forget, we're looking back here as well to keep an eye that seems to be firing out.
That's good.
The hair is good.
I missed him, but I'm not going to go back and get that.
Yeah, let's push forward.
So I'm going to toggle on to this a few and that doesn't give me the view I want is at this view.
Yeah.
So you can see like the moodiness with the purple and actually we've got parts that are showing here
that we don't want.
So let's click in.
In fact, let's go back a few.
I'm just going to zoom into his hair a little bit.
And again, we're just going to paint through here and just yeah, this is our edge and these that to
catch up.
And then we're going to say, yeah, here as well, this is all hair.
You need to keep an eye on this.
And so is this.
Again.
And in us, I feel I say this on pretty much everything at the moment, but you can be as accurate or
as inaccurate as you want to be.
Really?
That's good.
I'm happy with that.
I want that bit here as well, actually.
So let's paint that through because we use the Refine Edge tool.
It's telling us that what you're saying is, I'm painting this, but it's not all of the area that I'm
painting.
It will be certain parts within this area.
So kind of work it out and it's really good.
It does good.
So let's click through, go another few frames forward and let's see how it's tracking this rotoscope
quite quickly.
Looks good.
Good.
Let's click through again.
Not too far.
If you get too far, the cache can kind of loose and drop off.
But yeah, this seems to be doing okay.
Let's click through and I'll speed this up now, but I'll slow it down if there's anything, any points
of note.
Okay.
So as you can see, I'm speeding up this.
And to be honest with you, the main thing I'm actually looking for is his hair.
Everything else has tracked really quite well and is rotoscoping or is at least signifying the field's
very well.
So good that's done.
We're now going to we've got the propagating tool going all the way through here.
We're happy.
So I'm just going to click Freeze and that's going to take a bit of time and we'll come back once that's
done.
Okay.
So we seem to have been it's done.
Not too bad at all.
I'm happy with that.
And it's as accurate as I want it to be.
I swear to come back out of there.
And as you can see, he's been cut out.
And as you can see, looking through here to resolve a channel, this has done really quite well.
So this is a great starting point for us.
If I look down here, I'm looking down here by his shirt.
There's a bit where we've actually had a little bit of movement up with the track, but looking at his
hair, I'm really impressed for that track.
And yeah, that'll do as well.
Okay, so I'm going to come back up here and close this up and.
Right.
What do we do now?
Well, this next step isn't necessarily going to make sense, because I don't know if it's a glitch
in here or a certain way in which pre compositions are made.
But what we need to do is we need to decompose this.
But as you can see, we have the VRC icon here, which is just because I use VLC on my computer, if
I right click and pre compose and just press, okay, it kind of it gives me this and this isn't what
I want.
I want a different icon.
I'd actually wanted Tim Brown to know why it's in, but I don't know the technicalities, but that's
what I want to do.
So the way in which I have a workaround to do this is if I create a solid just dot grains, fine and
move it below.
I don't have to move it below.
I can see actually that's really highlighting just how well that's that's picked out as well.
I'm really happy with that.
What we're going to do is we're actually going to turn this off.
The only reason why we've got this size in here is so there's more than one item in this pre comp because
when I right click and pre compose now and press okay as you can see it turns brown that's that's the
pre comp that I want to show why but that's how it works.
Okay.
Now let's start making this.
So we're going to turn back on layer below, which is our lovely Golden Gate Bridge.
The motion time lapse.
And first and foremost, we need to drop down.
Remember off track mats.
We're going to go Alpha Mat.
Okay.
On the bottom footage.
And what that will do is a punch through.
And now this alpha because it's using the alpha track.
This is now the only place in this whole scene that the bottom clip shows through to the top.
Okay.
So as you can see, this is kind of the start of everything.
Okay.
So now let's build on this.
What we're going to do is going to take this pre comp.
I'm going to control D to duplicate it and then we're going to turn it back on.
And the reason why he shows now is because it's not the alpha mat of the bottom clip.
The reason why we brought him on is because we want to bring back some of his features.
If we get rid of him again, there's no features at all.
It's just literally the alpha track that's brought back.
And we want to give a hint of him at least and mainly in the face, because obviously that's where his
features are.
So what we going to do is we're going to create a small mask and by doing that, we going to click on
the pre comp.
Click on the Rectangle Tool.
And just on the top left we're going to drag, see how it changes because it's now looking for things
within this bounding box.
If I start to bring it over, see how we bring him back.
So we're going to bring this across all the way and bring it down to it just about here.
Happy with that?
Now, we want what we want to do is we want to feather this mask, okay?
So we can drop this down and we've got mask for the hair.
Shortcut I can keep on is f and we're just going to start dragging this up.
We're looking at this bottom edge here now just going to drag this up.
So we've got a bit of a feather between the two.
And if we let that go, that's good.
I want a little bit more.
You can feel this as much or as little as you want.
You see how we now going up into his face love that really like that.
So as we now play this back and this is really quite labor intensive for the computer that just bear
that in mind.
But if we play that back now.
We've now really got the start of everything.
And what you can see is you can see up here that that mask feather is now coming into the top of his
head.
I'm okay with that.
However, if you didn't want that, you just need to drag this mask.
Sorry.
Grab it somewhere.
Click out and then click and again.
Click this hold down shift.
Click the other ones with multiple selects in these two and then just drag up.
You could just obviously go off this way and this way.
If you hold down shift, it snaps the top and all of a sudden you have everything that I'm just going
to leave it there actually for now.
So now if we look back, we come back to fit.
We're masking at the bottom, but we've got all of his head in there.
Okay.
Above so he could do this for the circular mask as well.
But this is this is the way we're doing this today.
Now, what I want to do is I want to turn down the opacity as well.
Don't forget t on the keyboard opacity.
And you can also remember it because it's transparency.
But I'd like opacity and we're just going to track this opacity down a little bit.
Just we blend a little bit more.
We play that through now.
Okay.
So this effect is really starting to come together now.
I really like that.
It's looking really well.
The thing is, he's not really showing much the Golden Gate Bridge until he kind of comes over here,
is he?
And we kind of want that almost from well, when we get to here, we want the Golden Gate Bridge right
there.
But we've got a bit of room for movement.
So he could take that button, click clip, even press P on a keyboard and bring it over a little.
So it's there.
So now if we play it back from the beginning.
That's looking good.
I looked around.
Good.
Happy with that?
Although I do want it in there more so I'm actually going to keyframe this.
So if we position so position keyframe for our bottom layer further along until it's yeah, we want
to move that across there.
So we'll move that there and then let's move between the two to make sure.
Maybe move it across a little bit better.
Come across here.
Maybe move it a little bit more.
Well, he said I'm doing I'm just setting a couple of key frames then go between the two, the back
there a little and let's see how that looks if we play that back.
Okay.
That looks absolutely awful.
Maybe we don't maybe get rid of that middle key frame.
And what I'm going to do is we're just going to select all of these F9 to ease them.
You may want to move this, you may not, but I kind of feel like it needs a little bit.
Maybe it doesn't need as much.
Maybe if we get rid of that key frame, lay that back again.
This is just literally playing around, seeing how it feels for you.
That kind of feels quite natural.
That's good.
Happy with that?
And you know what?
I'm going to delete this last keyframe and leave it back there.
So you have a little bit more because remember this movement in this clip as well.
But yeah, that works for me.
Okay, so control and ask this and this is the start of what we're doing.
So now let's see what else we can do.
Control s anomaly.
Just done that.
Well, let's go back into Premier.
So now rather than the Alpha Channel we have that we've now got a black background because that's how
it works in Premiere Pro and as we track through.
Good.
Not so good.
So now we're going to do is we're going to give it a background and we're going to drop that one.
And then let's get somewhere where we can actually say, Good.
I'm going to go into premiere composer, because what we haven't talked about is the backgrounds the
premiere composer has and it has a lot.
If I just tilde this.
We've got Flo, which is always nice.
Forget about the clothes.
Forget about the word pink in the middle.
That's just kind of how it displays.
You can change all the colors.
You don't have to have pink and also you don't have to have the word in the middle.
I don't think they come in when you put them in.
But you see how we've got so many different backgrounds that you can just check on.
You can change all these colors.
What I want is I want a texture and I want this texture, hair, texture, background, too.
We're going to add that to the project.
So important that texture background need to bring the after effects composition above it.
So yeah, this is just literally working as a background.
If I didn't have that, I think we've got the black as we've just set and the the backgrounds.
You can make them short.
We can't make them longer.
You can't make them continuously longer.
But that's fine.
We're going to change it up and then we'll duplicate it to make it a fit.
The whole length.
And the beauty of this in here is that once you click on the background that you selected, you can
change all the individual clothes that are making this up, or we can go from a color palette.
I'd like to go with that color palette.
Start with see how that feels.
That almost feels like a starry night, although it's not, and we're not trying to emulate a starry
night.
But I think that yeah, I think that's a good start for me.
However, the thing with the texture background is you can make them shorter, you can't make them longer.
They are sets, but you can duplicate them and you can't see it when they start with repeating almost
like a loop.
But we won't do that yet because I don't think we're going to be using it for the whole of it.
Good.
Now, what I didn't do is I didn't duplicate this.
Still, you get this.
Remember, my computers crashed a number of times, so I think I'm running it quite hard at the moment.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to bring this guy in again.
Is that the full length?
Yes.
So that's the original.
And obviously, if we duplicate it, we could just bring it up from the top.
And thankfully, we haven't trimmed it.
So I don't have to meet up with anything.
And before I use this one, I'm going to do is I'm going to add an effect to this.
And to do that, I'm just going to duplicate the after effects pre-cut, because what I want to do is
I want to change the blending mode and I want to change the blending mode to soft light.
Now that's dark.
And this if I take off the bottom one now just to give us an idea, we've got almost like it's almost
like it's turned down the opacity, but it's kind of keeping certain things.
I'm going to play around this actually, and I want to do and say, what?
What did I choose?
Was it screen out for if I toggle this off and on now the opacity.
Yeah, it was the screen.
So this is a blending mode that we've come with this.
Now I know what this is doing is starting to blend with the background or anything that's below it,
and that works well for me.
So that's where I'm going to start as he turns his head.
And the reason why I've stopped that bear is because I'm going to move the background over and I'm going
to bring it just a little bit close because we don't need it all.
Then I'm going to take this top layer.
I'm going to cut it.
It's not being shown at the moment.
I'm going to cut it and I'm going to delete that.
Okay.
So now if I bring that back, I now have this effect which goes from him just turning around and then
boom point to here because we're going to create some kind of like dream sequence.
Give us a little bit more room to maneuver.
As he turned around.
Good.
Good.
Okay, so now we want to do some form of transition.
And what I'm going to do here is I want to use a light leak.
And the light leaks within premiere pro, within premiere composer are really good.
I love them.
I love the organic ones more.
And I'm actually going to go with this organic lightly.
I'm going to go with this lightly just because I really like it.
I think it's a lovely light leak.
So let's highlight that at the play head and press at.
So we've now got about likely which will.
Bring us into our dream sequence.
That's good.
I'm happy with that.
Let's just prevent a vest control and ask because my computer has been crashing quite a lot.
They're setting up their control and enter to pre render.
May take a little bit longer to get through here.
Didn't take too long to get through just the main video clip, but it will take a little bit of time
to get through the transition, which is the slightly organic one and also the after effects composition.
But we should be in a better position once we get to here to see kind of what we're playing with.
Because what I'm now going to do is when level on some audio because I hope you realize when we were
doing the the tracking composite adding audio can really I think just really helps to just sell everything
they do say that audio is worth more than 50% of the of videos quality.
People will forgive bad video or bad quality video as long as the audio is good.
So yeah, with that in mind, although the video quality isn't bad at all, it's it's exceptional.
The audio still has as much importance in this.
Okay.
So we have pre-rendered that take actually quite a bit of time and I could spend time telling you what
you need with regards to computer, computer hardware and all that.
But those things change over time.
So the most important thing I will say is that get the maximum amounts of ram that you can that you
can afford on your budget.
And the maximum are the best the best chip as in CPU and the best GPU as in graphics card.
And yeah, you just kind of need to max out a lot for these kind of things.
But when you have machine that can run them, I mean, wow.
So we're going to play around now.
We're going to play around with the audio, which will really help to sell.
So first, I want some ambience of like, I don't know, outside.
And for this we can go to motion array and I'm going to go to sound effects.
And let's just say I'm going to go in corporate with Django Wilderness, see if anything comes up.
Okay, maybe countryside with that.
It's with wind, is it?
Some of listen.
And to do this, we're going to go to Motion Ray and see what we've got here.
And I'm going to go to sound effects.
I'm going to tell you this so we can see everything.
And I'm just going to search for.
Let's just say maybe countryside first.
And let's see what we got here.
Quiet countryside.
That might be quite good.
We have to ignore her saying preview.
Pretty.
Preview.
Okay.
Yeah, that sounds enough of an ambiance that we need.
That's good.
I also want the cityscape so that stuff like the city.
So let's.
Let's just put city and see what we've got here.
Night urban ambiance.
If we use that before.
Is that what we used in?
Maybe, but not quite.
Was Metropolis.
Preview.
Preview may be the traffic.
Previously it.
How might work?
That might work.
Let's see.
Let's bring that down.
We're going to add effects to this as well, which will help sell it.
But that said, let's just build out this for now and those should be downloaded now.
My downloads yet bear downs.
They'll be in our motion array folder.
Should we start a new one of these?
Quite like working in here.
I want to have a traffic and quiet countryside.
Go down to traffic.
Traffic honking.
That, Trevor.
Maybe that's going from there.
I think that's a good segue to some of the I mean, there's some spots I've seen when I sat in there,
I'm going to just track the it doesn't give you the option for video because it's just audio.
We're going to bring this into maybe here.
Okay.
That might work.
Let's go back.
Let's get a quiet countryside.
A quiet countryside.
Could the.
I'll start there.
Oh, okay.
I quite like that.
Oh.
No, let's go for that one.
I like that.
So let's check tractor into the bottom as well.
So I'm just going to check that back.
Okay.
How am I going to get rid of that?
That points.
That's the transition bit.
And I'm actually going to take this beep and I'm going to bring it onto its own onto its own channel.
Okay.
So let's just have a listen to these first.
Okay.
So that's where I'm at for now.
Let's just cut that off.
Let's get rid of the rest.
Press the audio.
Now, what I'm going to do is I've already decided when I heard that Bieber thought, oh, I want to
do something with that.
So I'm on track A3 here.
So I'm going to do a lot of this now in the track editor.
So if you go to the track mixer, so we're looking for three, which is audio three here.
We're going to drop down one of these effects.
And what I want to do is I want to go to stereo imagery first and I want to expand it.
Okay.
So we're going to go maybe like a wider field.
So listen to that.
Now it's just so that for now.
So it's much more front and center.
Good.
Okay.
With then what we're going to do is we're going to yeah, we're going to run a bit of reverb.
Can we get some reverb in this.
Yeah.
Let's go for let's go for convolution reverb because what convolution reverb does is it kind of gives
you ideas.
Okay.
So like called House speaker, class, that kind of thing, let's say backstage area, see how that
sounds?
Maybe maybe not say unreal chamber.
So that's really going to be like really quite echoey.
Okay?
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe track down a little bit and fade on that.
Just play that back again.
Okay.
And I wanted to do something else.
I want to almost apply some echoes to this.
So if we drop this down and go to delay an echo and we want an unlock delay, so that still looks like
that.
And let's say you just got to you got to pick one drainpipe.
Was this.
Yeah.
It's it's it's kind of what I want, let's say taped to.
Try unlock.
That's kind of what I want.
Definitely what I want.
And now I'm just going to add a bit more reverb on this.
I'm going to go for and surround reverb and we're going to say game time, stadium.
Stadium.
So hopefully it's like.
E Yeah, that feels like.
It's like it's much further away.
I like that.
Let's just.
I'm just going to turn these off just by fax.
In fact.
No, no.
Or am I going to do I'm going to drop this down to a new lease of Tesla has none of the effects.
I'm going to solo this layer as well.
Just second, put them next to each other.
So this first one is without and the second is with
me.
It's those little things that will actually make the difference because you're adding certain things
to the ambience of it.
Let's go back.
Cope.
Happy with that?
I'm going to go with that.
What I want to do is I want to boost the ambiance beginning, which is audio track, too.
And to do that, I'm going to come to a multi-band compressor double click on this.
And I want to set this to always a classical master.
So this is one of my favorite.
I use classical master and broadcast a lot.
But that really brings it right to the front.
I'm actually going to turn up the output gain a little bit.
And by the way, every six decibels you increase, it doubles the volume.
That's kind of the rules of decibels.
Okay.
Good.
And now with this, what I want to do.
Is going to pan this.
Okay.
So what pandas is.
You go from you can pan left or right.
And what I want to do is I want to pan this from the right to the left as it goes through.
And if you're listening with headphones, it will be more obvious maybe.
Depends if it's coming out in model stereo, but yeah, you'll be able to see on here anyway.
What I want to do is I want to add a pan envelope and to do this with an audio, you know, by default
this is your volume it up, that's your volume here without doing it here because it's to the clip.
If I undo that and I'll do that and I'll do that again.
We're back on zero.
You right click and you want to go to show clip keyframes and we go to panel and ballots.
Now all of a sudden that line if I undo what we do is we go show clip for keyframes and panel and balance.
Now, if you look at this line here, it's just above this line here, which is the left channel.
But if we go to panel and balance, watch that line.
We now goes directly down the center, which means everything's right the way down the center.
If we bring everything up, we play that back now.
Can see and hear whether you can hear it in your headphones or not.
I'm not too sure, but here it's just out of the left channel.
If we bring it down to the bottom, it's all the way on the right hand channel.
If I bring this out, you can see.
So this is left.
This is right.
There's is right there.
If I bring it up, there's that.
So what we're going to do is we're going to pan this audio.
And if I undo an undo and undo so we're back in the center, I'm going to add a keyframe now to do that.
What we do is we hold down control when we've got a mouse over here.
And if we click once we've got a keyframe, see how it looks like a keyframe as well.
So I'm going to get that keyframe and I'm going to drag it up a little bit to about here, which is
kind of like halfway towards the left.
So if we look here, we'll have mostly on the left a little bit.
Being a little bit more, actually.
Okay.
And what we're going to do is down here, we're going to do control again and click through at another
key frame.
What we're going to do is we're going to drag this down to a similar bet right on the way to here.
So now what we do is you can listen to the audio.
He.
Right.
And then what we're gonna do is have another one.
So by towards the end, we're back to the sense of maybe some way about the.
And then it comes in track that I've put a fade on the back there.
Control and click.
And obviously this is pre-rendered now because we've got face going on.
But if I just add a pre render that play that back.
He.
He.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
Last thing we're going to do is to kind of sell this even more.
Almost like he's been, like grabbed into this is I'm going to add a little bit of key framing on this
first clip so we know that we have to be everywhere.
We have to be the scale has to be perfect and the position has to be perfect.
At the end of this clip, which is where the transition happens.
But what we're going to do is we're going to take that all the way to the end.
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to scale in just a little bit and maybe bring it down a little
bit.
So we're starting to move with him from the beginning of the clip.
And if we play that back now as we just pre render play that back, let's just close out that and close
out that and close out that so we can actually see properly if we play that back with the audio and
all the tracking through after effects, we're left with this effect.
He.
Global exposure.
Such a powerful tool, if used correctly.


### 21. Fly Through 3D Text

This is our original footage.
We're flying through Hong Kong.
However, if you didn't know the area, you wouldn't know that you were flying through Hong Kong.
How can we make it easy to know?
Well.
We could make this the 3D fly through text.
And as you can see, it literally looks like it's just there hanging.
In space.
That's what's coming next.
The fly through 3D text effect.
So there's a few things we need to do in a certain way to get this.
Now we're taking this from Premiere Pro because again, what I am all of these things that I'm working
on are working on the back of you want them in premiere pro a lot of people just work purely in after
effects I don't anything that I work with in After Effects I always always starts off in Premiere Pro
purely because I want options when I get to the end without having to then import from after effects.
Even though the vast majority of this is going to be done in after effects, we still starts off in
Premiere Pro.
We just have to because then we can do stuff with it.
So here's our footage right here.
As you can see, as you showed just now, this is our footage.
So just like before we right click the actual clip and we're going to create a new sequence from the
clip.
That's the first thing we need to do.
You don't drag it into a new sequence that you've created.
Let's just make sure everything is exactly the same.
Then we just duplicate like we've done before.
Right click and replace with after effects composition.
And as you can see, we are here now with our footage in now we need to do a couple of things first.
So first off, we're going to pre compose this just to make sure that everything stays inside, have
it move all attributes in there, adjust composition duration for the timespan.
This lets last.
That doesn't matter.
Let's just press, okay?
Just make sure it doesn't open the new composition.
So now we're outside with Brown and we know that she just come to Tracker.
If it's not open, click it there.
If it's not in this list here, just come to window and Select Tracker and then all we do is we select
track camera and that now just starts working through everything.
It can take a bit of time, depending on the quality of the footage and the speed of your system.
It's probably a good time to just go and get a coffee right now and come back when it has completed.
It can take a while.
And finally, after a good while, maybe a bath, maybe a shower, maybe a run around your local city.
And we're finally at this point where it starts to solve the camera and you start to cross your fingers
and you think, oh, did I remember to pre comp?
Is it definitely the right settings?
And then you get that.
If you don't, you get this.
And that's when you realize that you didn't become police.
Learn the lesson that I have learned many times before.
And so what you can see when you first solve the camera are all these little tracking dots.
Now, if you can't quite see them, they are quite small.
You can size them up over here, click in here or drag and just maybe 200, maybe the.
Yeah, you see how we can see them bigger.
And now what we want to do is we want to solve the camera.
But what we want is we want the text somewhere around the middle here coming through.
So what I would suggest is maybe finding somewhere here or the ground.
But first, let's scrub through and maybe keep an eye on the ground and see how they track through.
And they seem to be tracking through quite well.
It does kind of slow down a little bit.
So we need to kind of yeah, maybe drop down to maybe a third quality to be better here.
As you can see, this is quite a an intensive piece of tracking, especially if you've got really large
footage like what this is.
But I'm thinking these look.
All right, actually, I'm going to try here.
So what we do is just literally with our selection tool, selection tool selected and we kind of want
to we want to draw a trace a line around a few points.
So I do.
So looking at that, I'm looking at that little target thing.
So what we'd do is I'm going to just start dragging, as you can see, these start to create things.
I want those three points let go.
And it's created this.
If I zoom in a little bit and maybe move down, you can see we've now got these three selected and it
creates a target in the middle.
It's not quite level with this, but I think we'll be able to work with that.
So anywhere in here, you right click and you create text and camera for this effect.
So boom, we're done.
But as you can see, we have something down here.
If we step it now up to full, you can see that it reads text.
Okay.
So what has happened here?
Well, first we've created this text and now we have these crazy little things.
Once we click on it.
And that's because it's been made into 3D.
This right here is the 3D toggle and lever on there.
And we're now going to start to play around with this to get it how we want it.
So you see these little circles as your mouse over these these little bowls.
This will affect the y axis.
So control and that that this will affect the x axis.
So this will stand it up.
So we kind of want that first.
This is just the rotation, paramount.
And this one, we want to find the z-axis.
We don't want that time that to rotate.
It's just controls at that.
And now we use the y axis to bring it round and that looks okay.
So now let's move it a little bit.
And that looks to be tracking.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm happy with that so far.
Just them.
Yeah.
What we can do to make this a little bit faster that we're playing back is because Robinson before Dee,
we could say draft three day.
What that will do is if I come out, there's actually a wireframe that will now be around everywhere
that sometimes you see, sometimes you don't, depending if it's struggling.
Let's just go back to fit and play that through and see how that's tracking.
Looking at this down here and yeah yeah yeah I'm okay with that.
Seemed to be doing all right.
So let's get back to the beginning and let's grab this again and now let's start kind of putting it
into position.
So rather than grabbing the the circles so the ball's that halfway along base, we're now going to start
grabbing the arrows and with the way we want to move it up.
Okay.
So we've now moved it right up to where kind of where we want it.
And don't forget, this is a three this is a text layer.
So if you go into paragraph, when we go onto our T, so our type tool, if we click into here, we
can now type in here, so now select it all.
And this is actually a street in Hong Kong, so I'm going to type H, o, g, I'm going to put another
line and coingeek Hong Kong.
Good.
So now we've got that, let's say in a paragraph one I to character I we want to size this up, but
first we want to select a piece of text.
So I'm going to go with no Easter, don't judge me, but it's just peel because it's a nice chunky piece
of text and that's kind of what we want for this effect.
So I'm going to size this up now.
Could this a bit too much space in between them?
So I'm going to drop this down.
This is the space, the line spacing.
I'm just going to select a number which would be far too low, and then I'm going to drag it out just
to be about.
Yeah, okay.
I'm happy with that.
Good.
So if we play that through now, that seems to be coming right the way through, through our effect.
I love this.
I do, honestly.
I just love this effect.
I do want to actually sent it though.
I don't know if it looks sent it now going to paragraph in saying sent it, it might totally ruin our
alignment, but that's fine.
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't know, I'm maybe I may prefer it there.
As you can see, it's not quite straight to our view, so I'm going to just drag it a little bit.
And just got back there and yeah.
And if we pull it all the way through, come all the way through here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, what I want to do is I want to get a little bit closer.
So then we can fly through it.
So if we highlight it and if we think about what axis we want to go on, kind of what the Z actually
is doing.
Yeah.
So this is moving it out in space.
This is moving it closer to us since it may be about.
Okay.
About there.
Then I bring it across on the x axis.
I'm not going to rotate it slightly on the Y.
So it just looks a little bit.
More believable, he says.
Big text, buy something and don't wait.
We will make this look better.
I'm just going to check as we fly through.
Do we have a right?
As you can see what I want to do.
I want to go through one of the O's.
So I'm just going to I've just selected it here and it's handedly brought this up to the side for me
so I can keep my view but bring it down while I'm looking.
And if I now go through this yet will fly through there.
Good.
Let's come back, see how that looks when we come back.
Still quite happy with the position.
Good.
So we've started it.
Now we can play around with it.
I think I might want to change the colour, but let's just see.
Now, don't forget we put on cinema for D and the reason for that is if we drop down here on the text,
we now have our geometry positions because we're in three D geometry options even.
So we're going to go down to jump two options and we're going to start playing with this first.
We're going to extrude a little.
So if you start dragging this up, if you c look at the text file to do that.
It's now making it a bit deeper.
You can't really tell yet.
For reasons that I will tell you in a moment, it's to do with lighting.
Don't let that blow your mind.
But yeah, we'll come back to that.
So we've got our extrusion depth there.
We can also play with our bevel style, but not just yet.
Let's just drop down our material options and we want to make sure that Accept Shadows is on, access
lights is on.
If it's not, just click it and then just, you know, you don't drag or anything, you just click it
to say yes or no appears in reflections.
Fine.
We're not going to be working that with with this.
We just want to cast shadows, accept shadows and accept lights.
Okay.
So that you remember when we created a no.
Yeah, well, we're now going to create a light because we're working in 3D space and obviously the
whole scene is lit because that's a piece of footage.
But we also want to create some lights on here.
Now, what I've been trying to work out while I've been looking at this is which way the light is coming.
And if I look down here, I'm looking down now on to the street and I can see that the shadows are pretty
much directly underneath, but they're a little bit offset to the left.
Can I find anything else that would confirm that?
Maybe because of the shadows a little bit behind, we might have to use a little bit of poetic license
here, but we always want to kind of look for where the shadows are.
What about from these people?
If I just hide that text and now I see that they're still from behind them, that's behind.
So it kind of looks like the light is kind of coming from in front of us, but we're going to cheat
a little bit.
So turn that text back up.
And what I'm going to do is we're going to create two lights.
First, we're going to create an ambient and then we're going to create a spot.
Why can't we just create a spot?
Well, I'll show you once we've created the ambient in the spot, not turn off and I'll show you.
But first let's just create an we anywhere in here new and we're going to go for a light and we're going
to make sure that it's just an ambient light and the intensity I'm going to put it at 80% to leave it
at white.
So that's just a white light and we're going to hit.
Okay.
So you see how this just went a little bit darker.
If we haven't got a light on, it will just be lit or it will just appear if we now start to effect
with lighting, it affects the actual 3D objects in there.
And the reason why it's not 100% white is because we put on ambient at 80%.
So obviously if this is 100%, it would be fully white.
But we don't want to add 100% because we want to also be able to create some shadows within this.
This will all become clear when we create the next light, which is a spotlight.
So again, empty space, right click down to light.
And they were going to drop down and create a spotlight and leave that again.
And 80% leave everything here.
Whatever yours is, whatever yours is, just leave it at it, and then we can play around with it again
with the falloff.
Great.
I'm going to make sure it casts shadows as well.
And the shadows.
Darkness again, we can come into this, but right now I'm going to have it at 100%.
I'm just going to put a little bit to fusion.
Remember, when we do drop shadows and we blur it, that's very similar.
That's the similar thing.
So that's press.
Okay.
And now we have a spotlight.
Nothing has changed.
And that's because we don't know where the spotlight is pointing.
So this is the spotlight.
The ambient light doesn't really show up because it's just ambient.
But if we start moving around the spotlight.
It's not doing anything, is it?
So let's stop moving it back and let's find where it needs to be to be able to affect this.
Now we're moving it back, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.
So again, let's start playing around.
Layers of it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry.
You see?
Ah, you see?
Now there's the cone.
You see it?
Now we're starting to rotate.
This is giving us light.
So if we start to play around.
That is.
Yeah, it's kind of okay.
We now need to start playing with it a little bit more, see how this is front and back.
And then if we use the it's a lot of guess work, but the X, there we go that's going a little bit
higher.
You can feel like you're kind of everywhere and no at the same time.
But if you zoom out a little bit, it can help you see how this is now.
Yeah.
We're now we're now getting somewhere.
And don't forget, you can animate the lights as well.
We're not going to do that unless.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to add too much.
But we're.
We're going to place up there.
And if we start to move forward, you see that their light moves everything with us.
And.
Yeah, okay.
I'm happy with that so far.
Let's go back to Fit.
Actually, I'm just going to move it back just a little bit.
The reason why I brought in this this light is because we want to create some kind of shadows within
the 3D.
If we toil this back down with the text and remember we we added an extrusion depth.
If we now start to play with that, you can see how much, how long we can make it.
So I'm just going to bring it back just a little bit, not too much about that.
And what I also want to do is I want to affect the bevel so we can select what Bevel style we want.
I can either have angular, concave or convex.
Let's try angle and see how that looks.
See how that kind of adds to it as just zoom into a little bit there.
Don't forget, we're on draft 3D.
If we take off draft 3D, it will render a lot better.
But we're just using draft right now just to make it easy for us.
We can actually drop down to quarter as well, see how it all it goes.
It doesn't render like that.
It just, you know, it just helps.
It just really helps.
And just going to drag this up a little bit and that's a little bit too much, we can then work with
our extrusion depth to kind of make it maybe a little bit more like we want.
Let's just go for concave.
No, we don't want K and convex.
We don't want that round to take it back to you.
Okay.
Okay.
So I actually quite like that.
Com.
And don't forget, we can always change the or change the text if we want to.
This H in this K are now really close together.
So I'm going to change this up a little bit, track the line spacing, just kind of offset them a little
bit.
Good.
Happy with that.
Let's close that up and now let's play that through and see how it looks.
As for flying through.
Might start a little bit too close.
I might want to.
If we take it through a little bit early, we're already like through it here or to maybe let's grab
this, zoom out a little bit, kind of get it back.
Come on, give me the controller twice.
Okay.
Okay.
Just going to grab the and just push it back a little bit.
So as we're coming through here and move it over a little bit, we can actually at this point get our
title and action safe to make sure that we're exactly right as we're coming through here.
So then tell us a little bit about that.
Can we do that handle again?
It's back and we got that.
And as we're coming around here, is that where we want to be?
Yeah.
Does it?
Are we just going right through the middle of it where?
I see.
I just don't want that so much.
We can go down to our positions and let me just go back here as well as affecting base.
We can play with these as well, which will affect the height and this one affects the Z.
At the other one is the X and this is the Y.
So we can continue through here.
Now that we've got our position up, we can.
Come here.
I don't want four white.
You see, I want it to go through the whole of the.
Oh, so let's just use page down now.
He come in.
Come in.
A few more frames.
Yeah, it just needs to be aligned just a little bit to the side.
I do.
I'm not even doing the right one.
It's just one.
Here we go as we go here.
Yeah, we fly a fly through it.
Good.
Happy with that?
And now that we've moved that back, the spotlight isn't quite on it.
So I'm just going to grab this a little bit and move it round.
Rotated down.
Slide.
There we go.
Fully let's we've almost got here's the hotspot and it goes through to a little bit of a gradient through
there.
And don't forget, we can change the color.
We just select the text and come up here.
So we like the orange.
We could grab our picking tool and select that click there that's now given us our orange and yeah that
was quite cool.
That doesn't that you could add another light as well coming from another direction, another color.
Let's go for it.
You know what?
Let's go for the the kind of the cool, trippy cinematic color.
So if we go for this purple on there, for the light yet for the text does help if you've got the text
selected to that purpose.
It didn't for that purple there.
Cool.
And then if we add another light spotlight, it was a sight light and we want a spot and we want the
blue like there we need like kind of like that kind of blue and grab that and now we just have another
light to position.
But if we bring it to the side, rotate it round, and here we are.
Now we're getting this, we want that kind of just affecting that.
I just want to change that color.
Maybe we need to give it like a bit of a dark color to get this effect.
And let's bring this intensity as much light intensity there we go to a hundred and see how now that's
kind of planted that in.
So let's move it.
That's not the way we want to move it.
Why don't we get maybe the speed up on the of the set?
We rotate this round the other way.
Okay.
So are the lighting that way now?
So if we bring this down a little bit and then rotate it up.
See how that's feeling in there now.
It's kind of maybe not what we want.
We bring that down now.
Yeah.
So you see this little glare that we've got along the edges here?
I turn it off.
It's just getting that little bit more of a pop.
Once you show like that, that color.
No, it doesn't really do it for me.
That's maybe pick that orange, actually.
Okay.
Let's have the highlight of the actual text highlighted or selected, even orange.
Now, it's definitely not the orange one.
What might be a little bit more yellow?
I like that.
Hong Kong.
And maybe actually, I don't want the devil.
See how you've got so many options here once you start playing.
I once had angular bevel bam like that and the extra depth.
I'm just going to bring that down to maybe ten, just to close it up a little bit.
And then as we close that out, close that up.
Let's just hit zero on the keyboard.
Oh, looks good.
And it starts to stutter a little bit, just kind of control as they're going to draft 3-D, turn that
off.
And don't forget, we've got a composition settings.
It's got a 3D renderer.
It's still some 40 press options.
Bring it up.
So kind of wherever you want.
It's got extreme quality for a highly reflective layer.
Now, we don't have any reflections.
That's cool, but it's typical them.
Okay.
Press.
Okay.
And press.
Okay.
Control s that's going to say about that project.
Then we're going to come back to Premiere Pro and there's a clip going to press.
Oh, there I there.
And render that out.
And now that were fully rendered, it didn't actually take too long.
Just have a just a reminder this is the original footage looks great.
Anyway however come back here and now I mean look look how well that's tracked.
And remember, we were tracking off this bottom bridge going across here or whatever that is a country
and it just works perfectly and it could just be them in real life.
And the beauty of this, now that we're back in Premiere Pro, is that here's what I made earlier.
I spent that up to ten.
I spent up to 400 neth by 400%.
Play that through and we have it.
Let me just give you a cheeky example of what's coming next.
And just for the little bit of wizardry that we like to call speed ramping, we've now got this.
Just as we come through, we come back to a real time.
That's cool, huh?
So that is your flying through 3D text.
And although the system takes a while to actually create this effect, to actually create this effect,
does it really take that long at all?
As you can see, it's really quite effective.
Next up, speed ramping.


### 22. Speed Ramping

Speed ramping is an effect that is used quite a lot in, say, music videos and any kind of B-roll that's
to music that you kind of want to you kind of want to push the feeling of the music and high frame rate
video is best to do this because we can play with the the speed of it high frame rate obviously being
the fact that you can turn it into slo mo or have it at normal speed.
However, the example I'm going to show you isn't to the music, but it's part of a music video.
And the music video that we're talking about is one that was talked about before, and that is Forest
Funk by Scott Comanche.
Now, I have mentioned this in earlier chapters.
We shot this whole music video and it was so much fun.
We've done a number of music videos with him since, but this is Forest Gump Funk, and the whole premise
of this is that you do whatever you want.
In fact, the title is Forrest Gump Funk.
I do, and I want now and I'm going to take this section.
In fact, if I just zoom up a little bit, can I find it this far too many channels on here I think
is actually down here.
Do I.
Can I.
Yeah.
It's just off to here.
So it's it's here.
It's actually this nested sequence here.
We'll show you from here just to kind of put it in perspective.
And so we started first let me just mute this.
Let me just scrub so I can show you.
And so he started with this bit, which was kind of establishing the scramble bike.
So he's in a completely different outfit.
He has a pink power ranger right behind him of the dance, which turned out to be his anti.
We have these scramble bikes around.
So that was kind of like this set up.
Then we have a close up of a bit of nothing to the music.
The kid down here, I think he's called Holly great little kid and these lads were by the end of So
Get on the bikes.
And as a result we were able to get this shot.
So is this bike coming, flying over and then down?
Thing is there's a bit of speed ramping in here and there actually isn't.
I did a cheat of a speed ramp, but I'll show you the cheat that I did.
And it was just really for time more than anything, because it was a last minute thing.
And I thought, Oh, that would go good there.
And we had to deliver a draft quickly.
And the client loved it, so we just left it.
I thought, Well, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it, but I'll show you what I did and then I'll
show you how better to do it, if that makes any sense.
So let me play this through.
And what you're looking at for this is as it goes kind of real time and then slows down, then comes
out to it back in real time.
That's kind of the speed ramp effects.
But let me just unmute this and you're looking for around here, in fact, I'll put a little marker
for you here so you can see where it's coming up.
But this puts it in perspective for me.
One.
Okay.
So that's the bit that we want.
We wanted to kind of get that that moment and to show you that I'm going to go into I've actually copied
the nested sequence over to here because if I start playing around with the nested sequence, it will
start to create problems in the main.
Edit So although it's been, it's been sent to the client.
Yeah.
I don't want it there just in case we ever have to do anything.
And so let me just right click and play in and out and let me just show you this without anything.
So we've got this running real time and then we're slowed and then we're down.
You can see there's actually three clips.
Let me just show you kind of the behind the scenes of this because this drone clip, if I that's the
whole drill clip, I think is it it's completely there's nothing at the beginning now.
And this whole drone clip was over 5 minutes long, five and a half minutes long.
And I was I was up just flying.
I'm a licensed commercial drone pilot as part of what we offer our clients.
And if we just kind of play this through, I'm down on the ground somewhere kind of down here, just
lower of the camera.
And the important thing with regards to droning is the fact that you kind of keep you and what you're
filming and where the drone is kind of in mind.
You can't just blindly be looking at the screen unless you've got a spotter and then explain why when
we get to this point.
But we had little Holly come along the the, the, the, the course and yeah, it just started like
kind of getting things in line.
And I know this is the shot I want, but I'm not too sure where I need to be.
So I took a few, a few trial runs and I know that the bigger lights are kind of going around at this
point.
So if I skip forward, I'm checking all my settings and checking my footing.
There's another bite going down there.
And now I think, right, okay.
I kind of want to be here.
And then I saw the bike coming through and I thought, Oh yeah, I start to panic a little bit.
And I thought, Oh, I don't want to get too close.
So these things, although you do a happy, you can get a happy accident and get it in the first take.
It's not often the case.
So this is the shot.
I'm kind of getting close and I think, right, okay, maybe I can get a little bit closer.
And I'm watching this guy going around not only on the on the screen of my tablet, but also here.
And I thought, okay, that was all right.
I kind of left it as he moved and I didn't really want any kind of altitude move while I was there.
So here I am again trying to run the shots and okay, that was okay but still wasn't close enough and
we are shooting in 4K.
So I knew that I was I could zoom in if I needed to, but in all honesty, I wanted as much quality
is as possible.
Really.
So yeah, I just.
I kind of.
Just perceived.
Probably not the right word, but I really kind of worked at it and I thought, you know what, let's
just try and play around a little bit, get some more shots and come back there when I feel a little
bit more comfortable.
And this is important if you're working with footage or you've been footage that has been sent to you.
The important thing to do is to look at all of the footage because you may think, Oh yeah, that's
okay.
And back there it looked like a good shot, but a couple of them these had was going out.
I think this guy's head goes out again.
So start to think, okay, well, I can't I can't film it looking down.
I have to be looking straight at the very least.
And the drone that I was flying on this day, it was the original magic air actually from DJI.
And I couldn't I can't angle up at this point.
And yeah, I was really close there and I looked at just before the need to move a little bit don't
want anyone crashing then great thing is these guys wearing helmets and in all honesty, the biggest
the biggest effect from anyone hitting the drone is that the drone will be broken, but that's fine.
So here at this point, I think, okay, Kimbo needs to be absolutely straight.
So let's get it straight.
And I see this guy coming around here and I think I that the guy that does the kind of side lean so
I thought, yeah, so I'm getting close.
I know where I want to be.
And so I just start following him and going back.
And that was my shot.
Now, the thing is, in the actual in the actual camera, you think how I got that shot?
So I did go back.
That's me.
That's me.
I'm actually using a tablet there.
As you can see, I've got my full kit on my back because we had the camera in the gimbal and all that.
I don't want to leave it anywhere and dust everywhere.
So I close up everything and just made sure I wasn't in the way.
And I'll say I stood somewhere where I wasn't or I was less likely to get hit by anyone.
And I think, yeah, that was my show.
I was I was confident of it, so I didn't kind of go again.
And as you can see on this side, I did actually try a little bit just in case there I thought, you
know, I've got it in the bank and I was really confident at that.
So with that shock.
But here we are back again.
And if I am just going to duplicate that up and if I play it out here, let me just put a mark here
to see where I'm at.
And we got up to there.
Can you see how that mark affects that mark?
Because it's the same clip, always handy.
And yes, so this is the shot in real time.
We can tell it to your target if we right click and go to speed duration.
We're a hundred frames a second.
We're at 100%.
If I reveal in projects, I can see that we're shooting a 59.94, which is it's effectively 60 frames
a second and we're playing in real time.
So this is a real time.
And I thought, Oh.
That's what I want to do.
I want to kind of slow it down for a moment.
So that's what I did.
I took the clip and I as you can see, I cut it.
So let's just let's kind of just play with this.
I'm just going to close it out for now.
Going to lock it.
I know that I cut it back.
So this is the lazy version of.
I've I've actually speedrun thing.
Let me just put another mark here.
So it's there.
Okay.
So what I did, if I look that up again, what I did is I, I took this and I thought, right, this
is where I want to slow it down.
So I put it there.
I then start to drag.
For that moment I thought, okay, that's all I want.
So then I cut it again there, and then I move this up to about here and I right click this went to
speed duration.
I went 25%.
So I took it to 25% length.
And here is this secret.
As you can see, it kind of if you look here, it's not quite I slowed it down more than it should be
because we're at 60 frames a second and we're put out putting it 25 frames per second.
I can only really slow it down by about 50%.
Anything lower than 50%.
And I'm kind of close to being too slow.
And the secret in Premiere Pro is to right click the clip, go to time interpolation and make sure it's
an optical flow.
If I want frame sampling and I play that back, you see how it's stuttering to watch it again.
And even if I pre render this.
Thank you.
If I play this back and watch you see how it's.
I hope you can see it.
Let me tell you this.
How it looks like it's stepping and you don't want that.
So if you it doesn't work for everything, but this can really save you bacon if you right click and
go to time interpolation optical flow what it will do.
It will make it much smoother.
It flows better.
So I knew I could get away with that.
So that's how I did it.
Straight up.
Boom.
And slow down again.
So that is the cheat way off speed ramping.
And if that works for you, crack.
Go for it.
However, the correct way to do it.
If I still got the marks up here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
That I have to do that.
Let's come up here and let's turn back on this track.
He's up there.
So let's go back to about.
Let's go back to about here and.
Let's just say no.
What I'm doing here is I'm holding down shift and making these clips taller.
And that's really important for speed ramping.
You'll see why very shortly.
So I know that at this point I want to slow it down about there.
I actually want to slow down a little bit earlier.
I want to slow it down about that.
I don't really want these markers less and actually going to hook to the source and just clear markers.
So they're all off cool.
So I'm going to put some new markers of my own, so I'm just going to maybe talk about that because
as he's going up, just going to put a marker there.
So with the clip selected press m on the keyboard, I'm probably going to go through a pile there,
just about to go down and then we can continue down, right?
So to be able to do this all in one clip, it's really quite simple and I'm not too sure why I didn't
do it before.
Maybe just a little bit of laziness, but on the clip, anywhere in the clip, you just right click.
I want to go to show clip keyframes.
Then we go down to time, remapping and speed.
Now what you're looking for is this line here.
You see this line here, just like with the music, it's the actual level at first and you can change
it to pan.
This actually sets the opacity.
So if I go into my effects controls, you can see that I've turned down the opacity to 11.9%, drag
it all the way up to the top.
It's 100%.
You can't get it past.
Actually, it's all the way at the top.
You can't get more than 100% for opacity.
So what you want to do is want to right click, keep looking at this line because it'll change right
click down to time, remapping and speed, click on that.
And all of a sudden we have a line going right through the center because through the center is 100%
anything above it is faster, anything below it is slower.
What does that mean?
Well, let me show you hold on out and scroll in a little bit.
Just we got a little bit more room to move.
We've put these markers.
This is the best workflow for us.
So we know kind of where we're working.
I'm just going to put one marker here.
The way to do that, let me just move out that just here and we'll hold down alt control on the keyboard
and click.
You see, it gives me a plus for them over the line, click that and it gives me a marker right through
that.
Let me just explain what that is in a minute.
I do not want to put a little marker there.
Now these work very similar as the handles in color in as much as I like to try and draw parallels because
it kind of helps if I had just two markers, I move this down, it would move everything.
You see how it's moving, everything.
If I just had one, it would move everything.
However, if I've got three markers, if I go, maybe click there and click there, I'm now just moving
within these two markers.
That makes sense.
And with that premise, we're kind of apply that kind of similar premise to this.
With the time remapping, we've put a marker that we've put a marker here.
So if we move anything here, it just just to the left of that line, if we do anything here, it does
anything to the right to that line.
However, if we do anything here, it only affects between the two markers, between the two marks we've
placed.
So let's put this in perspective.
Once we start grabbing this line and slow and dragging it down, you see how we've got a percentage
also look to the right hand side and that marker starts moving away because what we're doing is we're
slowing down time and we know we can take this down to about 25% and we'll be okay, but let's just
take it down to maybe about 50%.
Yeah, go on.
Okay, so that's 50%.
So now what we've done, if we play that through going 100%, 50% and then down, as you can see, 50%
doesn't really make much of a difference.
So we are going to go down to 25%.
That's why I must have done that, because I didn't really feel much of a change.
So let's get down to 25%.
Let go.
Play that back.
That's better.
And did you notice?
It was on a frame someplace.
So for playing it back that don't like it.
So if we go and we right click time interpolation and optical flow.
Save my bacon.
Good.
So that is time remapping.
But as you can see, just like when we cut it, we've got we've got a normal, normal, normal, abrupt
stop, and then it starts again.
Now, that's the effect that I wanted to go for.
I like that.
But we can change that if we zoom right the way to here and we click on one of these, we now have what
looks like a blue mark, but actually these are two marks.
If we grab one, maybe the left one and start pulling out.
That now affects how long it takes to get from one speech to another.
It's creating a ramp.
A speed ramp.
That's where the term comes from.
So now if we play that back, it actually slows down.
It doesn't just change speed.
It slows down through it.
And if we click again, we're now given the this handle.
And if we.
Start to drag this handle.
It will change the curve if we make this little bit taller.
You can see me just tilt at this axis.
You can see properly if we you see how it's affecting the curve so we can make that ramp as gradual
or as abrupt as we want to.
This would be the same as when they were both straight together.
However, as we've tracked this out, you can see it gives us more of a smoothing in to the slow mo
as we track this out and give it a little bit more room.
And I tell I don't play that back.
See how he slowly slows down and then he speeds up again.
Let's just do the same on this one.
Dragging out quite a bit.
Give it a little bit of a rough.
Says a little bit.
A lot of it is that.
Oh there I there.
And just pre render that.
And if we play that back now, where normal speed, normal speed, normal speed, and then we're going
to ramp down to slow it.
And then speed up.
You see the difference when it speeds up.
It's like he just.
Drop.
It's almost like gravity takes over more.
Whereas if we look at the first one.
It just drops out.
It's subtle.
And I guess that's why in this quick fix.
It didn't really matter.
But if it's a piece of music that has, like, a instant like drop like that.
No, maybe not.
Instead of a gradual, maybe something like this.
And that will be better because the ease is in.
Hey, yeah, it's a great it's a great technique.
Is speed ramping and we're done correctly.
It can really make a difference.
But what I want to say, just to finish this up, because I know it's only a quick little tip, but
the most important thing is if you're doing this, even if you're not slowing it down to a point where
you shouldn't be doing like we're down to what we on here or I'm like, yeah, 25% maybe take down to
let's let me show you 11%.
Let's just pre render that out again.
I haven't I've never taken it down this slow on this clip, but I'm confident that it's at least going
to be.
Usable.
And what's making that happen is optical flow.
If I go back to frame sampling and pre-rendered.
Again, you can do as much pre rendering as you want.
But watch this now.
It will look.
Absolutely garbage.
Unless that's the effect you're going for.
But I mean, seriously, that is the exact same footage, the exact same shutter speed.
And the thing is, when you come back to 100%, it makes it stand out even more.
Watch, because we're ramping out.
It's so smooth to come out that it's like, well, that just kind of loses it.
So the most important thing to take away from this, other than the technique to speed up, is optical
flow.
Honestly, it can make footage that you don't think is going to work with the effect you want.
Work brilliantly.
Speed ramping.
Good, isn't it?


### 23. Scribble Effect

I love this fact.
I really do.
I already got this footage downloaded from Awkward.
It's just, I actually saw this.
There's loads and loads of clips from this this session that these two lost it.
And the just the great, great, great dancers.
But I selected this clip for a number of things.
The number of times he kind of is moving around, he's hit the ground and it's this effect back hallway
to work with.
So, yeah, let's do it.
So we've got a clip in here.
We're going to right click and we're going to create a new sequence from the clip and we're going to
go into our lovely after effects because it's another after effects effect.
Hold down alt duplicate it.
You should know by now right click and replace with after effects composition.
Now this has not I've not opened up after effects.
So we're going to say this is a new composition and hopefully it's got the place where we normally save
it.
Good premiere pro animations.
I'm just going to call this scribble effects this it's just a standalone after effects animation for
this and it's really quite easy to do this.
I love it.
You can be as meticulous or not as much as you want.
You can use your app, you can use your mouse, you can use a graphics table.
I've got a graphics tablet where you can use like a pen as well.
Just can you use the mouse for now just to kind of so, you know, everyone's at least got a mouse or
a touchpad and start the software and double click.
So we get into the actual clip.
Okay, so start from the beginning.
And what we need first is we need paint.
If we go into window and we select paint here, you're probably not going to have it here.
I'm going to click paint here and then we're going to select exactly what we want.
And now that we've got paint open, it's still grayed out.
Well, that's because you can't paint with a pointer, can you?
And although this is a scribble effect, it's called the scribble effect.
What we need is we need the brush tool.
So up here we click the brush tool and the minute we click it, keep an eye on here, you click it and
boom, we're here and we're done and we're ready.
So first and foremost, if you draw with your brush tool, as you can see, we have a squiggle controls
there to do that.
And so first we need to decide what we're doing, what size we want, our brush and what colour we want
our brush.
You can change the colour later on, but it's easy to do it at this point.
So, okay, what do we want?
Well, we want to see what kind of a colour that's in this scene or do we want one that contrast set.
This has a kind of a blue hue in it, so I'm thinking maybe a hot pink.
I don't know.
I'm just a sucker for a hot pink in in stuff like this going to go for maybe this.
I do I absolutely love hot pink.
So as you can see here, we know.
Yeah, it's good.
Is that the right size?
I think so.
Maybe size it up a little bit.
As you can see, once we pour in paint brushes as come up as well, not to show if it's when you bring
up paint or when you click on the brush.
But if we click here, this opens up the brushes below and you can kind of change it.
You can change the diameter there, the quick selections here.
So 13, 17, 21, these are really different sizing here.
This is 24.
Happy.
I quite like that size.
Actually, brownness is 100%.
You can actually make it like it's almost like a a calligraphy pen if you wanted to if you wanted to
maybe write some lettering
so I could be a doctor if I was clever enough with that kind of handwriting.
But no, we're going to we're going to have a just 13 roundness of zero.
In fact, I want to go 21 to say 21.
Yeah, I quite like that.
And, yeah, everything's fine.
Pen pressure is good if you're actually using a pen, but for this, it's not really going to matter.
So we just start to draw and what we can do is going to be drawing frame by frame.
And the only thing we need to change before we start scribbling or drawing or painting is that we need
to set the duration.
Now, what often happens, you know, if we put in, if we just come out of here and we put in maybe
some kind of graphic like text click on here, it creates it for the full duration.
We've touched on that before.
What we don't want is we don't want full duration.
And by default, that's what this will be.
So we go back to the brush tool and a federation.
We want it single frame.
Okay, so what we draw will only be on for a single frame.
Let's just double click on this again to get into the actual letter.
And I'm just going to scroll up until I see somewhere where I want to play boom.
Maybe there, maybe as it comes up and what we need to do is it can this takes a little bit of thought
really and you want to kind of anticipate I want to kind of do it almost like he's kicked the floor.
I'll go boom and trace him up and then trace the other one.
So.
Well, we need to start somewhere, so let's start now.
So now you want to use your page up and page down keys to go forward a frame and back a frame.
If you don't have page, you're a page down.
By the way, if you hold down control on your keyboard and press right, it will do the same thing.
You just need to use two keys rather than one.
But I use the page, open page down.
And just as he comes there, I'm just going to do a little line there.
Okay.
And then if I go a few frames, you'll see what I mean.
So I want to go there.
I'm going to move my mouse just here.
I'm not going to do anything.
I'm just going to have it here for like kind of an effect that's there, I'd say, and then go again.
I'm going to go here just three.
So if I play that back now.
It's kind of.
It's just a moment, isn't it?
Boom.
But if we kind of do that and also let's just get to that frame again.
And as he comes off, I'm just going to draw a line.
I'm going to go again and it's a bit further up.
Draw the line a bit further on.
Draw a line and maybe another one there.
And as he's come there, I'm going to go back now.
And as his left foot starts to.
Follow it or do similar.
Yeah.
That's enough there.
Play that back and.
Okay.
So you can see where we're going here.
I'm not going to take his hands into perspective, into consideration, even.
Okay, let's just go frame by frame.
Watch what his hands are doing.
That's starting to move there.
So I'm going to maybe talk a little squiggle here down again, maybe another squiggle there.
Another squiggle there and another squiggle there.
Oh, let's just undo that.
Let's get another squiggle, maybe to.
I'm happy with that.
Let's look at his backhand.
His backhand goes.
Too little here, a little arc here.
Not a lock here.
I was shot as slowing down.
Even shorter.
That's good.
Let's play that back and see what we've got.
Okay.
I'm happy that so far.
And now let's just pick out these little things.
So he's kind of hit here.
So let's just we're going to repeat that again.
I come out here?
They just chased another one, as if to accentuate what he's just done there.
It's just go back and get that back foot boom.
He's hit the.
The shockwave goes to about here and to about here.
And then I want to get maybe that movement.
Want to get some movement as he's moving that back and going forward and back, as you can see, just
casual that line there.
Learned a lot there and has this.
Yeah.
We got that pushing down.
It's kind of this movement here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But let's just play back and see what we've got so far.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Let's get those arms again.
Cut that.
Looking at this arm now.
Like, Oh, maybe something like this.
I like this.
I like this trend a little bit different.
Now, as you can see, it doesn't necessarily have to be that accurate.
Play that back.
See how that looks?
Good.
I want to get this, but I've just.
I'm dying to get this, but.
So let's get as he sets his feet.
Somewhere on there.
Love a bit more room down here, but we don't have that.
So we're working on what we have.
Go out here.
Go out there.
Well, that's not really worth it.
He's moving his head forward, so I'm going to get that as well.
Here it goes.
I'm going to get this now.
So that first starts, we're going to do a line, the line there.
And they're trying to kind of follow where he's come from.
I love linebacker, long linebacker, linebacker lunging and they see how it's just kind of trying to
remember where they've been.
It's kind of come around their.
Wow.
As far as really.
Now that's that's really I mean, I know I do have to be accurate, but you can be a little bit more
accurate than that.
It's kind of a buck and see if that's the effect we want.
Hey.
What is that around his head?
That.
What is that?
Now, that doesn't work at all.
And if we don't like something, if we come down to you, come down to here, go down to effects paint,
and we can kind of look for it, really.
So if we go back to selection and it's this bit here.
This right here, and it's Five-O.
So I'm just going to delete that so that we go forward again.
And that's probably 51, is it?
Yeah.
And delete that because you're creating little brushes and every single thing is no more than I was.
It was just the two.
Oh no, it's that one as well.
Which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
Select that.
That's 49.
Get rid of that.
And.
Good.
So if we try to close this up, see how many strokes we have created there.
And come back here.
Play that through.
Mm hmm.
That's as easy.
Okay, now, when I get this fixed, well, so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to trace him because
this is always a really good facts as well.
We're still in here.
Good.
Get a brush and watch this now.
This is this is great effect.
So we just continue you.
We need to be a little bit more accurate.
Let's just trace the outside of his body.
Okay.
So tracing back.
Tracing that round to of a black.
I'm going to trace about that round and here maybe outside of his arm, but some of his foot is going
to come around here and down here, and then we're just going to repeat that.
So we're going to come all the way up there, round the top.
Round here.
You can imagine the fun you can have with this.
Like where it's just.
It's it's as accurate or as inaccurate as you want to be.
And sometimes the least accurate effects of the better, or at least have more of that scribble effect.
I guess that's why it's called a scribble effect.
It literally is just a it's it's not a perfect outline.
If it was a perfect outline, you'd use a different till you use a quick selection or something like
that.
But with this, it's just that she getting.
And I of his outline.
And I'll speed this up until I get to a friend that I like.
And let's see how it looks at the end.
And so after that, you kind of you pray and you hope and you think, has it worked?
And we get through that and we get to this fair and you think, right.
Has all those frames?
Has that been worth it?
Let's play it back.
Let's watch it together and see if we think it was worth it.
It looks good, doesn't it?
Yes, a little bit.
So at this point, I started chasing him out and after a little while I thought, right, let's just
go back to the legs and the head because they're come out wide and just going to like the fact that
he's coastline.
Let's go back a few frames and.
As his hat comes away from him.
I'm just going to jump around it.
I love this effect.
It can be used as much or as little as you like.
I know this is kind of like pointing out dudes you fell off, but, you know, it's all fine.
And actually I'm going to not draw that around that like that.
The beauty is you can create, you can go back and you can do more.
So as it starts to go off.
I'm going to kind of maybe do some.
Almost like like a whoosh.
It's kind of give it maybe the added speed.
Maybe.
That could work.
The thing is, when you once you start getting into the thing, right, I'm going to animate that.
I'm going to scribble around that.
You start thinking how far down the rabbit hole do I want to go?
Just a few more.
As if it's gone off the screen.
Take that back.
Get all that sequence.
Brilliant.
Obviously, you could go through this whole the whole footage under the control unless they're come
back.
I'm just going to add another little bit to this, and that is just a little bit I know we've had a
bit of movement with this movement in the camera, but if I select this and get the scale to 100, maybe
take the scale to maybe 120.
So it's kind of zooming out as well.
I don't think I need to put you under the ISO.
Let's just play that through.
I do have to.
Sometimes you start getting things like this.
I think there's an update with regards to the GPO on my system.
The good thing is any kind of stuff that you see on a screen like that, I've started getting like some
kind of screen tearing, so you kind of get lines through it, not the line that you saw, but kind
of like it's offset a little bit.
It's always important to remember that that kind of thing doesn't come out in your render.
It's just kind of in the playback, and it can be quite frustrating.
But this is what happens when you're using in newer products like my GPU is only about six months old
and a graphic cut.
So there's always updates going for that.
There's there's updates for everything.
So, yeah, that's something to bear in mind.
If you start seeing artifacts, you think, Oh, that's not quite right.
Best thing to do first is to please to render out, prevent that, see if it's still there.
But then again, that's always tried and tested.
You may then need to render out just to see if those artifacts are then as a pre-rendered that's still
there.
So what I'm going to do is just to prove to you and just so there's no there's no doubting, I'm just
going to prevent do this and I'm just going to go to my renders here and I'm going to render this out
as a dancing scribble hit.
Enter on a cue that up in my encoder bring that in.
We haven't actually shown exporting in a while, as you can see, we can't see those lines there in
the playback as it's rendering.
But once this is rendered, I'll show you this back and we should all be good to go.
And as you can see, if I just I just put this into my VLC play playback.
Don't forget VRC player.
I'll leave a link actually in the course for this because it's just brilliant.
It works on both Mac and PC and it's a great lightweight media player and it does audio and video and
it plays back pretty much anything you throw at it.
So it doesn't have to worry about codecs or anything like that.
But as you can see, there's no artifacts on here.
It's just a full on fondness of this cool dancing fella.
I just love this effect, the scribble effect.
It's.
It's brilliant.
So you don't worry if you see any kind of playback artifacts, ventilate that.
It's still there.
It's all cool and it looks great.
I love the scribble effect and I hope you do too.
You can make so many fun things.
I just.
I just love it.


### 24. The J-Cut and Why it’s Important

So for this chapter, I'm actually bring you into one of my previous edits for my channel, and this
is an explanation of the jacket and how important it is.
It's quite a subtle way of cutting.
And the reason why it's called a J Coats.
This is one example of the J coat.
And it's because rather than a straight coat, if I just let's just grow this a little bit rather than
a straight coat where the video and the audio cut at the same time, like, say, maybe here, see how
that's just a straight cut back.
Play that back and I'll show you.
This is a review for a great, great little tripod.
I absolutely love it.
By Kobe Tech.
They sent it out for review, but this is a straight cut led panel and put something on there.
I personally can see me using this for an external microphone.
Granted, if you're using a mirror, so that's a straight cut.
Whereas a jay coat like we see here, it's, it's, it's kind of in the letter J we kind of ignore that
we go down here as well.
It's kind of like a whatever it's called a jacket.
And J is when the top track cuts later than the bottom track see it to me and it kind of kind of doesn't
because we've got a cut here as well.
But let me let me show you what a Jake looks like.
I don't really trust anything on it anymore.
So the upgrade for us that I made and what that does is it allows what's being said to kind of hit home
while we're not waiting for the that the voiceover or what the audio that's driving the narrative to
take longer, he says, taking ages to explain that.
But let me just play that.
Let me play you another one.
This is another.
Jake Go a long way, CHASE.
So first off, hardly kind of noticeable, but it is subtle, as I said, and it can be a subtle or
is really kind of right in your face as as you like.
And all of a sudden it's unusable.
Not only that, but the rubberized bits are.
So let me take these two because these are two J cuts.
And let's just go to the end and let's show you what it looks like without a J cut.
So let me put that here.
I'm just going to duplicate this as well so I can easily refer back and I'll show you kind of what has
actually been done to create these J cuts.
Let me just bring that out and bring that out.
Bring that back and bring that back and that.
Okay, good.
And ripple delete these by selecting in the middle and thing.
We all know that unless you played without the j cuts and all of a sudden it's unusable.
Not only that, but the rubberized bits are wrapped.
I hope you can see that if trust anything on it anymore.
So the upgrade for us, it kind of looks a little bit, I don't know, amateur, whereas if we just
take that last one, that one really kind of stands out to me.
Well, I don't really trust anything on it anymore.
So the grip and give you the other version if I can get that quick enough point that well I don't really
trust anything on it anymore.
So the upgrade for us that I mentioned, you get what I'm saying.
And the easy way to do this is we're going to be using our alt key.
Okay, so I've cut this.
If I, if I track this out and kind of play it all the way out, you can actually see that there was
actually cut there because at usable.
I held because I knew I was going to be doing a joke.
I repositioned.
Not only that, but the rubberized bits around the side.
So this does need to be cut anyway.
Let's just get rid of this now because we'll just use the actual, original full brush and let's just
see where we want to kind of cut.
So we're playing it through and all of a sudden it's unusable.
So I'm not going to wait until I blink.
Okay.
So that gives me options.
So if I kind of use my arrow keys and click back and I don't want my hands moving either because that
will kind of ruin the effect.
But that's probably about that.
So I cut that there and then I'm going to go to where the audio picks up again.
I'm reading the audio now because I know that that's where I'm going to start talking, obviously,
and I'm going to on my keyboard cue because a lot of everything before that.
So that brings everything over there.
So now we have this.
It's unusable.
Not only that, but the rub.
And now what we need to do is we need to fit this audio underneath here.
Now, you could unlink these by right clicking and unlink and then kind of move these independently
of each other.
However, there's a much easier way of just undone all the way to real ink these.
I'm not too sure if it's actually a keyboard shortcut, but I've actually used Al on my keyboard to
link, and if I select them both and press Al again, I've linked them back up again.
If you just a quick refresher, you just need to check if you go to keyboard shortcuts in edit and search
for link.
And scroll down.
It's actually control L but by default L, K and J.
I think they're kind of shuttling.
Yeah.
Shuttle stop.
Shuttle left.
Shuttle right is normally Al.
I don't use those.
I don't see any real need for them.
So I just I sat Al for my keyboard shortcut to link and it works great in my workflow.
So what we're going to do here is we're in a fitness underneath here.
And to do that, we now need to kind of if we start doing this.
We're now cutting up where we're at and it's not really going to work.
So the way in which I do it is remember with Alt.
If you want to select, you hold down alt and you just select one thing and you hope you use the alt
key also with this.
So rather than just selecting, if we hold even if it was selected, if we hold down the alt key and
start dragging this, it's only going to track.
The video.
These two still say linked, but they now have a different kind of starting point.
And that's perfect because that's what we want.
We've got to kind of eyeball this, but I've tracked kind of as much as I think I need, and if we track
this up and that looks to be the joke, it's unusable.
Not only that, but the rubberised bits are round.
That works for me.
Now let's say we drag it too far and we kind of came up here.
And we've gone far too far.
Well, if you had some audio here or you had no audio here and you'd actually cut it longer, you could
use the alt again and drag this up here and then maybe drag this up here to Max.
But obviously that's not going to work because it's unusable.
It's around the side of these.
So what we do is, if you've done too long, let's let's do two long again and you've dragged it up
here.
Well, you don't have to go back and guess again.
You get your audio where it is and then just hold down Alt and drag it back up.
Now, if we play back and all of a sudden it's unusable.
Not only that, but the rubberised bits around you can see Jake is just I just absolutely love it.
If you really wanted to sell this, what a what we're effectively using as a jump cot, but it's not
because it's offset and that's what makes it the jacket.
If you really wanted to sell it that little bit more, what you could do is you could come to this next
clip and you could maybe drag it in a little bit.
So if we got this and maybe if we put on our the most important thing to do when you're doing this is
to try and keep the eyes where they're supposed to be.
So if we if we grab this and actually this is now off centre, but we don't worry, we put on our guides.
Don't forget if this isn't here and you need it, you just need to go to the plus and drag this down
into your buttons.
If you don't want that all the time, you just need to go view and show guides.
But I always have it down here, and what I always do is I kind of put a line on where my eyes are because
that's where your viewer is kind of looking towards, See, okay, I'm showing them something in my
hands, but they're looking at the eyes.
So if we now use that guide, keep the eyes on the line and I'm going to scale up just a little bit
and then kind of bring down to go on the eyes.
So then what that does is it kind of gives us a different perspective and all of a sudden it's unusable.
Not only that, but the rubberised bits around the side and that just kind of gives you another kind
of feel of movement and production.
It's not it's not necessary and sometimes it's overkill.
But I think doing that kind of with a slight reposition of the talking head, it just it keeps your
audience's attention.
So that's always, always a really, really lovely touch.
But just the Jayco is just it's so handy in editing just to keep the whole everything moving forward,
but also at least selling the emotion that you need, the jacket.
It's one kind of cut that needs to be in every editor's tool back.


### 25. Constant Zoom Effect

So if you just seen the previous chapter, you'll know this sequence.
We've been in the sequence before, but I want to use this sequence because actually I don't have anything
else to show it to it.
To give you an example of this effect, and I'm actually going to be use in the clips out of here.
The thing is, we're going to have to do something with these clips first, because this was the first
time I'd played with the SLI part, which is a motorized slider, and I was able to create this effect
for the video.
Is this the tri flex from COBE attack?
We're also going to be looking at the magic arm that they've bundled here with it, lynx, and now that
was multiple takes with the slider going to be exactly the same time and then kind of just sequence
in them as you can see, one, two, three, four, all the way up.
However, what I'm going to do with this is I'm going to create some stills and that's just purely so
we can we can make what I want to make here.
But I think I think showing you me doing this as well is going to is going to help as well because it
just I don't know, it kind of sorts out.
Well, it kind of reaffirms what we've done in the past.
Now, I want this here because that's in the sense of maybe a little bit further actually, maybe actually
even a little bit further.
Look out there and obviously I've disabled all the clips above.
If I press zero on my number pad again, I might have to reposition these a little bit, but that's
fine.
Let me just turn off.
Okay.
Maybe now will work with it with this.
So the thing is, I need to get a lot of stills from this.
So I'm actually going to mock this first one.
I could export some frames, but for ease, I'm just going to do it this way.
So I've that first one there.
I'm just going to copy that.
I'm just going to go to the end here.
Remember, this is where we were doing all the jackets and stuff.
I'm just going to press into that.
And what I want to do here is I'm going to insert a frame hold on all of these, which is going to give
me a section which is just static video.
Remember, we've done this before, right click insert frame hold segment.
Well, rather than just what we're going to do on all of them, which if I do it right we can't multiple
used to be able to multiple.
Okay, so let's just do it this way then.
So select the first one.
Insert frame hold segment.
Good.
Let me move that over there and delete that.
Come back and I'm going to get rid of that top on.
I'm going to insert frame hold segment.
Actually, I'm not going to do it this way.
If you wanted to just do one that's crackin.
But if you want to do more than let's not do it that way, let's export the frame.
So you've got the you've got the icon there, which you can do it.
I've also set it to C and I'm going to import into project here and I'm just going to set this as we're
going to go for 3 to 1 now.
Five, four, three, two, one.
So I'm just going to set five.
Obviously, you can select where you want to put it.
I'm just going to press.
Okay.
It should put it here as well.
Good as five.
I'm then going to hide that.
I going to press C on my keyboard again.
Type four.
Okay.
That's going in there.
I'm just going to continue hide that one, press c43 and press zero to get rid of it.
We're going to see again, we're nearly there to.
And hide that one and say why?
Because although these are all now images, what you can imagine is if you are just going to drag these
onto the timeline.
Now, what you can imagine is if you've got all of these, if you've got, like static video and you
bring anything, bring in a product, give it a second.
A video and then you change it.
Give it a second.
That's kind of what we're emulating here with these these screenshots or these exported frames and just
going to reorder these four, five, four, three, two, one, bring one there.
Bring three there and bring two there.
Okay, cool.
So now I'm just going to triple delete, close them all up and let's just see if they're long enough.
Yeah.
That kind of works for me for this effect.
And what we're going to do, actually, I'm going to make them a little bit longer.
Yeah, I'm going to make that a little bit longer.
Now, I could do that individually, dragging them all out.
However, how long are they?
1226 torches.
Okay, so they're only about a second, so let's just delete all those.
I've got them highlighted here.
I'm actually just going to go in name order.
So we've got them.
One, two, three, four, five and a select one.
Hold down shift.
Select five.
Right click.
And I'm going to go modify.
No, I'm not.
Speed, duration.
I'm going to say instead of 1/2, I'm going to set it to 3 seconds, boom, done.
And now if I grab them and pull them out, see how how much bigger they are.
It's a I know we've done that in an early section, but it's a really easy way just to just every time
images or graphic elements in here.
So as we scroll through now, if we play it through.
Good.
Might be a little bit too long, but it's fine.
Well, do it for this fact.
Okay, so now what do we want to do?
Well, first and foremost, I don't want them to be clipping all the way through.
I want them to maybe crossfade.
So that's easy.
Where what I want to do is I want to get a grow all the way through as if it's kind of magic.
But we can't just select one and then start to keyframe that, because you'd be, if you want one constant
grow, you'd be working out numbers and you'd never get it right.
You'd probably spend hours trying to get it right or some kind of maths equation.
And we don't need to do that.
It's really quite simple.
You hold on control on the keyboard.
Once it sort of saves hold on controlling your keyboard.
And we're just going to draw draw a mark.
So we're highlighting all of the clips or the differences between the clips right in the middle here.
Okay.
That's all we want to do.
We don't want to touch the ends.
Okay.
Bear that in mind.
And we now we're going to go shift and D and that's created a crossfade across all of them.
Why is it a crossfade?
Just to recap, if we go down to effects, we go to video transitions and dissolve shift, they will
apply across dissolve because our default shift D is a default transition.
And this has the blue background.
If you wanted to have a different transition as your default transition.
Don't forget you could just right click.
So you wanted to wait and that would be selected as your default transition.
Let's change that back now, just before I forget.
Good.
So now we have this.
So we've got the box, and then we've got the box, second box next to it.
And then we've got this, and then we've got bass.
And then finally we have this.
Now, that's good.
It's.
It works.
However, we want to put some movement on this and the way we do that and to keep that movement running
all the way through these transitions is that we select all the clips and we nest them.
Now you can right click and then click next.
Or if you followed along and done my my show clips is just an on the keyboard.
And I'm just going to you can relabel this I'm not going to rename it.
I'm going to press.
Okay.
Now, the reason why we didn't put the fade at the beginning, at the end is because if we had done,
we wouldn't have been able to see it on the nested clip.
We don't need to see in the middle of the clip, obviously, because they're all just running.
But what we can do is we can do the exact same thing, just control and drag over these and just hit
shift and D on the keyboard and that gives us our fading and fade out of the whole sequence.
So with that done, we now have this and it's just like what we saw before.
So what do we do now?
Well, we want to kind of give it some kind of movement and we could zoom in or we could zoom out.
And the way I want to treat this as I want to zoom out, because right at the beginning, we have very
little we have a box and at the end we have the kind of the finished a whole setup.
So the way in which we're going to do this is we're going to set the scale keyframe and set a position
keyframe.
Now, we may not need the position keyframe, but we're just going to set it anyway because this is
how we want to be at the end.
And I'm going to drag these to select these two keyframes by dragging a little box around it, and it's
going to move them right to the end.
Okay, now we can do the first keyframe and drag it over right here.
But what I want to do is I want to get right to the beginning, because this is the first frame that
we're going to see.
And I'm going to effect this.
I'm just going to twirl down, you know me, I much prefer sliders, so it's going to twirl these down
and I'm going to zoom in.
And actually, yeah, we do need that position keyframe because I want it corrects top and bottom.
So we're just going to drag this down as the little that's that.
And I'm going to grab these two keyframes and bring them out.
And now if you play that back, we now have movement going all the way through.
Tony Slight.
But this continuous camera movement can really sell the whole effect.
You see how it's it's just moving.
I love this effect.
And while that looks quite subtle on here, depending on what footage you're using and how many clips
you've got, it can really just I don't know, it just really helps sell it rather than just having
them side by side.
Because I've seen nothing has changed in here in the nest.
There's no movement or anything.
But rather than just having them side by side and fade and crossfade into bass and then crossfade into
parts and crossfade into this, I just think giving it that little bit of movement, it just it just
adds still a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a seasoning on the top.
A little bit salt.
Pepper, maybe, but I do like my food.
But yeah, that for me is just a great touch and a great addition to what you're doing.
I call it the constant zoom effect.


### 26. Vanish Effect

Okay.
So for this effect, we're going to go back to a music video that I mentioned before.
You've seen The Forest Gump Folk by Scott Comanche in a previous chapter.
This is a song called Happy Mundi.
And it's it's a beautiful song about a lady.
This is a lady called AMA, who played the title role of Happy Monday.
And it's quite a sad story.
She, the lady who this story is all about, happy Mondays.
You've known locally is Happy Mondays.
You such a happy, happy soul.
But she suffered greatly from depression and sadly took her own life.
And Scott, the artist, wanted to write this song.
And we took we took a lot of time to make to make this because it was quite a poignant story.
And we wanted to kind of we wanted to kind of give the feeling that she was no longer there, but not
in a in a cliche, twee way.
So what we did was we established her, and there are a number of scenes in this video, just like most
decent music videos.
And we established her in certain scenes.
First, let me find this bit where she's running through a puddle just coming up here.
So this area here, let me just play the animation that I'm going to use the combination.
So it established this scene which was looking straight up a dirt track really and how she's having
fun.
I love a lot that she.
My lens got filthy.
So we have this this track here.
And we also had a bit of footage of her of a funeral or, you know, we mocked it up and we we we sought
out the location and we had this pit, which was actually had a funeral, which is actually the only
time that we had the the singer Scott Comanche actually there.
This is when they gonna miss you by day.
I'm gonna miss you.
So this.
And this is the wake.
Let me just meet this.
Now, this is the week that we that we had that we shot for Mandy and kind of on the build up to this
remember yeah we have touched on this before because we have the the wife of fact number one.
She she met the drug dealer.
But what we also had earlier in this in this whole music video was everyone at her funeral.
So we kind of set it here.
So we have her totally different color color great on this we've desaturated.
It made it colder and we have a few close ups of her and then we have her here and this actual movement,
if I just get it back to there and show this, this movement here face like that, you can see it's
been qui framed.
We shot a 4k and we have puts it in 1080 so we had room to move so this we come back to but this is
kind of whole establishing that the kind of being at the graveyard and being at the gravesite.
So we use this shot and we also use her running through the puddles and we create the vanishing effect
like this.
So here we have a hair and then she vanishes.
And here we have her here walking down.
It's a slightly different version, but again.
She vanishes.
And what what we the technique we use to do this is actually built on what we've done in the previous
chapter, which was the constant zoom effect.
So let me just get in here for this 1/1.
And as you can see, it's only just two clips.
Let me copy that.
And let's just paste this out here.
So we can we can look at them.
So we've just taken them out of the oh, we've copied and pasted them back out of the back of the nest.
So what we did was.
Let me just add let me just hide that for now.
And if I show you the whole edit, this is obviously without the colour.
Great.
But we had our here.
I just make it a little bit longer.
And then what I asked it to do.
Was to step out of scene.
We haven't got the idea but is.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
I got out and what we did is I made sure that I went back to the focal point.
I kept the focal point and the camera was on a tripod locked off.
And I just got a few seconds of that.
In fact, I'm going to delete that and I'm going to show you here.
So let me just get where she's got out and she's that good.
And the beauty, the whole importance of this is setting up the shots and knowing what you're going
to do with the edit, which makes you different from a camera operator.
This is what makes a videographer, and that is someone who not only records but also edits.
And if you know what you're looking for and you're not known as a camera operator, you can explain
it to the camera operator what you're looking to get.
And for this, my instruction would just simply be get a locked off shot with the talent in shot and
then get the talent out of shot and continue for 5 seconds, 10 seconds to be on the safe side with
that locked off shot with the with the focus not changed.
What I did is I set focus on here and then I set it to manual focus so it wouldn't move.
So what we do is we just play that through a little bit.
Get as much as we can, can or as much as we can.
But will we be out by now?
Yeah, we'll be out by now.
So what we do is we just delete that.
Oh, sorry.
Cut that.
And then I'm just going to shift and delete, close them up.
And what I like to do, I mean, we could crossfade to, just to easily just do a crossfade and just
fade that in like that.
Boom, it's done.
I like to overlay just so I can.
I can.
I've got the freedom to go back and forth and get the crossover exactly where I want it rather than
having to play around here.
So all I do is I'm going to put a just select the end and shift.
And what we're looking for is we're kind of looking for everything to kind of look the same, which
is why we're using a cross dissolve.
And if we kind of drag that cross out a little bit, we can allow ourselves just that bit of time while
she gets out sharp.
And you see if it was a little bit too long, if I just go in and out there to fully re pre render that.
And if the if the fate is too long obviously because there's wind here, we need to kind of think about
the trees.
And the trees are important because if a cross fading too long on the tree is different, it can kind
of it can ruin the effect.
So if we play that now from here.
You can see we see the movements in the trees and we don't want that.
We really don't want that.
So what we can do is we can kind of close that off.
It's still a little bit.
So there's another way to do this.
And I kind of nailed it wherever I did it the first time I nailed it.
And sadly, I'm not doing it this time.
So let's say you've got footage that doesn't allow this and you're and you're thinking, oh, god,
there's too much movement in the background.
Well, what we can do is we can leave this as a plate behind and we can bring this over here.
Let's just get to where she there.
So let's cut that.
And just going to delete that.
And then what we do is we reverse.
So we put that plate.
That's the background.
And this is effectively going to be the foreground.
Okay.
And then we just crop these to duplicate them.
And where are we going?
Yeah, we're going to after effects, right click replace with after effects composition.
Now this is purely to get the top layer done, but we're bringing the bottom layer just as a reference.
Okay.
So this is now opening in a new one and I didn't have it open.
So we're just going to say Monday, we're also.
And that will load the footage in here and then I will resize.
So we're actually in here and now we can see Mandy right there and she's not there.
Okay, so what do we do?
Well, we we hide this for now because we don't need it and we just going to double click.
And what we want to do is we want to mask out everything around us.
We want to get Mandy could also get some of this as well if we need to, but we don't really need to.
We just want her.
So we have the selected, we're in the layer.
We go to our rotoscoping tool and we start the process that's got her quite well.
We don't have to be too angry about this because it's quite a long shot, so we're quite far away from
her.
Don't need that and we definitely need that.
That's part of her whole get up and just want that as well.
Good.
Happy with that.
Maybe just a little bit more bash.
We zoom in and have a look.
We haven't quite cut all of her hair, so I'm just going to track this in Refine Edge Tool.
I'm just going to go around here and just say, this is our girl.
This is what we want.
That's all good.
And from this, this is what we want.
My have to keep an eye on her hair a little bit appealing because it will be blowing in the wind.
But this is a frame rate mismatch.
It's absolutely fine.
Don't worry about it.
It's no big of a deal.
I'm going to go back to my right brush tool.
I'm going to zoom out a little bit.
I'm just going to start clicking ahead and let that propagate in between.
Obviously, propagates is a term that you've learned by now quite well.
And yeah, so we're just going to leave this work its way through and we'll come back once it's done.
Skip for a little bit just to save your sanity.
You know what you're doing with regards to rotoscoping and then freezing time and now that that's all
frozen up, we come back out and there she is, cut out.
And if we turn that back on that she's in there and there she is without the background, we're going
to leave that background turned off.
We're going to control and s to save that come back to premiere pro and if I just hide this for now
disable we have remember we have right here we have this one with her in and we have the bottom with
out her.
So what we're going to do is we're going to turn this back on.
We're going to hide the layer with her.
And as you can see now, when I disable that on video to look around here and all we have then is our
talent trait there.
So then all we have to do is if we bring this back and add a cross, dissolve, play that back, and
if only she disappears.
And because it's only her that's in there on the Alpha Channel, we can make this as long a fade as
we want just by going in rotoscoping and just being that little bit more accurate rather than crossfade
in between two clips, we literally effectively superimpose her over a slight.
So a slight being the background that she's not there this same scene but without her.
And because of that we can fade out as slowly as we want to.
So that's how to go even more detailed with that.
Now, to move along, I want to also look at this sequence, which is her walking up and away.
And if you look here, as you can see, we just got a cross dissolve across, dissolve on a long crust
dissolve.
And she's not there as long as my system keeps up to speed and done right.
And the way in which we did this is that you can see that there's no camera movement here at all.
And if I go back to here, I'm just going to paste that in and I'm actually going to delete everything
apart from the first clip.
I'm going to drag this out because this will be the whole walk going along.
And obviously we started right at the beginning where she's right by the camera, so she walk by the
camera.
So to do this, to make this effects, all I did is I played through and with my my back slash.
Remember, we have a keyboard shortcut to add edit if you haven't already done it.
If you search for ad edit the default is control.
K I have it just on the backslash switch on my keyboard is just to the left of Z.
I just find that a lot easier, especially if I'm going between that and control z for Undo.
So I'm just going to have this clip highlighted and just kind of play through and cut where I kind of
want to.
Forward and I'm going to think in and out.
So when we press play, we're in.
I'll be out.
Leave it out.
Maybe out.
Leave it out.
And then, of course, again, to be in.
And then out again.
And waste a little bit longer.
In.
And then maybe out.
So we're going to space that.
So I know that this is out, so I'm just going to click that whole downshift and click the next one
from, you know, where we're in and click that one where we're in.
And now if we just hit delete on the keyboard, we have all the spaces.
However, if we highlight these again and hold down shift delete it will delete them and close them
all up before deleting.
So boom, that's done.
Now what I want to do is I want to check because let me just click that again.
Let me just look through more of the footage.
And yet she moved out a shot and then she was there.
If she hadn't moved out of shot, we could have used some from before she moved in.
But I'm going to keep that one as well because we need her out of shot.
And now to get the start of this effects, all we did was hold down control and drag over these and
shift D.
So now we have our.
Slowly fading to ashes at different places.
And there.
And then finally she goes, It's a bit annoying that the light's changed between these two.
That was really annoying for me.
But, you know, you can't you can't sadly control the sun.
If I did living in the UK, I'd probably have it all the time.
But let's go in there and out there and let's just recomposed that again the pre composed pre render
wrong programme.
Adam And I've made this just a little bit longer when she finally exits from the scene just to kind
of give it just a little bit more something.
Actually, I'm going to cancel that for you and because we don't need we're going to do something else
now.
And if I could just play that back to that last bit and she.
If the machine wasn't stuttering.
And yes, she's gone.
And there's very little movement up here, so we don't need to rotoscope her out.
So now that that's done, if you remember to if you remember back and the previous chapter we did the
constant zoom effect.
Well, I'm just going to apply that again.
So we select everything.
We haven't faded on the ends.
Press end to nest.
Hit enter.
Don't need to label it.
And all we do is we do exactly the same before we go scale and position and drag back to the end.
And they're going to come back here and we kind of want to zoom out again.
So I'm going to play in a little bit, maybe, yeah, maybe 130.
I don't think we need to bother with a position, but let's have a look.
Play that back, pull that back even to the beginning.
And as we go now, because the scale starts at 130 and goes down to 100, we're slowly moving back.
And as you can see, everything around her makes it look like it's all one movement.
And we continue the movement after she goes to kind of sell it.
That was where we moved the camera.
So maybe trimmed that and off there and.
Yeah.
And actually on the original video, we use that as the finisher.
And then the main lyric is, see you later, happy Monday or we'll miss you, dear, sweet Mandy, rather.
So we put that on the end with a little typewriter tool, a little plug in.
Absolutely.
Love that.
Big shout, actually, to the typewriter still.
If I go to Adam editing and we set save layout, this is by a fella called Daddy Media.
He is David O'Dwyer and he made this and I just bought it in Spark.
I think the couple of quid and it's brilliant because there is not currently a typewriter tool in Premiere
Pro but he made this by daddy media search for him is brilliant and he's on YouTube and it's just it's
a great typewriter until you drag this and you start playing with it and you go into editing and you
can select what time it takes to write on.
And it's brilliant.
Just seriously, Google Typewriter dialed in in YouTube and you'll find him and tell him Adam sent you.
He doesn't know who I am.
But anyway, playing this back, we use that in here and I'm just going to pretend to this because I
know that my system will suffer.
I think it's running a bit hot at the moment, so it's going to control and enter just to pre render
everything.
And yeah, we should be good to go to play that tier.
Actually, I'm going to go to Right to the end because we kept see how the music finishes here.
We left it.
We left the the ending of the music video just, just to tail off a little bit, just so we just didn't
go straight out.
And with that pre-rendered, we'll watch you back.
In fact, we'll go from this bit.
Yeah.
We missed you this Monday.
Peaceful, as you say.
We actually decided not to have it typing on that.
We just used that and I just cut it up so we could actually use it just straight on.
But yeah, looks lovely.
That's the vanishing effect.


### 27. Automate Sequence to Music

I've got to say, I absolutely love this technique because it gets you a nice quick edit.
If you're just looking for something nice and quick, let's just just kind of double click in here and
just Tilde this and we have an absolute load of footage.
Some of the footage we've used in in the course so far.
You recognize Kevin?
They're having a good dance.
You know, his name is.
And there's bits where I haven't used either because I've just drag them down for this or that.
I kind of got down and thought, Yeah, okay, we can use something better.
In fact, there was all these running scenes, but I wasn't too happy with and I don't know, I can't
see the one where we actually find the use.
But anyway, I only told them about I'm going to go back to the list view and to do this I'm just start
it and I can talk you through it.
So I'm just going to cause six are going to start to sequence for this and we're going to just say time
to music, but just call it back and then we're going to bring in the music.
And I've selected this music from the Motion Ray plugin.
I absolutely love Motion Ray for this.
Obviously I could go through a list if I wanted to deep dive, but I got this to get higher.
Have a listen.
Absolutely love that truck.
And one of the main reasons I've picked it is because there's a definite beat, and I love a definite
beat because that's really important for this tutorial.
It's not that important, but we're going to be timing to a beat.
So that's what I'm going to do.
So it starts off.
We've got all our footage here.
We need to work out when this footage is going to come in.
So we're going to go right to the home, we're going to click out and nothing is selected and find the
mark on your timeline.
And then you just kind of make like, you're a drummer.
I'm going to end now.
So there's a mark right at the beginning because I want something right at the beginning and I'm just
going to play through and just press the AM on the beat whenever it takes me.
If there's something that's different than the music that you kind of want to accent, do that.
If you miss it, you can always go back and let's just have a listen and a play through and let's just
mark out some beats.
Keeping an eye out down here.
I mean, they will duplicate up here as well, but this is where I'm going to be marking.
So let's play it through.
That's probably enough.
There's quite a lot there.
Every single one of those marks is going to represent a piece of music.
I went on the off beat a little bit.
Well, I didn't say that I am actually a drummer.
I used to teach before I went to uni and I haven't been on a junket in the best part of ten, maybe
12 years.
Let's not talk about that.
So, yeah, we've laid down our track.
We may have put more marks than we've got tracks for, but that's fine.
So what we can do is we can sit in and out points on all of these if if it so takes your fancy.
So say this first clip is of a someone dancing.
We could go through and we could set our in and out points here.
So say we want it to go in there.
We could press in there and you pull it along and press out.
Now the endpoint is more important because it's going to bring in when it brings in this track, this
clip, even.
It will bring it in at this point.
However, if the beat, when it's in kind of comes before this out will be out before it.
So that makes sense.
I think it does.
So anyway, except that you could go through and you could set at least when you want the track in.
But let's just leave it for now and see how it does.
So what do we do?
Well, we select the first track clip, even music clips and tracks, and select the bottom one with
shift held down.
So we've selected them all and then we go up to clip and automate to sequence.
Just need to do a few more things in here.
You can either have ordering as in selection order or sort order.
If you actually let me just get back out here.
If you knew which ones you wanted, say see what happens.
Because we did the in announcing that we could start.
So let's just select that one, then hold down control and then select some of them in whichever order
you want.
Then select the last one you want.
I'm just going to tell that out.
You don't do anything just yet.
And then we're going to go to back to clip and automate sequence that that is the selection order.
So that's there or sort order if you're doing it by name and you've already named them maybe one, two,
three, four or five all the way through.
Good.
So we select at unnumbered markers.
Which are these?
If you just left it sequentially, we'd actually put them all in the full length or obeying all the
ins and outs one after another.
And we're going to so we're going to select unnumbered markers.
We want to overwrite, edit, we don't want to insert the edit use in and out range if you set it.
If not, doesn't really matter and you got to go press.
Okay.
And what's the magic boom?
However, where was my play had?
First one comes into play head.
So should we do that again?
Yeah, let's leave it end, because I think it really helps if you've missed that step.
So you play hard right at the beginning.
These are all good because clip I've lopped off there.
So we don't overwrite any of the music and we just go to automate sequence.
Yeah.
Dun dun dun press.
Okay, and boom, we're there.
So now let's just zoom in and let's see what we've got.
We?
Yeah, we almost had enough.
Enough clips for Marcus.
I'm just going to tidy this up by holding down alt and selecting the bottom and then just deleting them.
And then we can do a little bit a clean up here.
The ice isn't quite long enough.
Sometimes it does that.
There's another clip there which isn't quite long enough.
That's good.
That's good.
And let's play it back and see what we've got literally in just a couple of clicks.
You ready?
Problem?
Well, she's all the way in here, and it's supposed to be all the way out here.
Easy way to fix that, as we say, just to highlight why this is now.
It says 100%, but it's not.
It's actually.
It's like that because 100% is too in dead.
So this footage, if I mouse over this footage, why is it that myself that and give me what it is maybe
I need to go back to here to find it.
What she called was one called 8748.
So it's the first one.
So that's myself about and it's yeah.
3840 by 2160.
So it's at least four.
Okay.
So if we highlight all of our clips, right click and set frame size boom, we're in.
And now if we play it back,
okay, my system is struggling a little bit.
Let's just, let's not do that.
Lets pre render and let that just run.
The thing is if you're running your system hard, pre rendering can really help.
I know it's a bit of a pain.
My system is actually quite a powerful system.
Just goes to show with the screen recording and over on top it does kind of slow it down, but that's
how I play this back now.
In fact, I'm just going to close these panels just so we can really see all the magic, if any.
God I am.
Let's go.
Check that out a little bit.
How easy was that?
Seriously, how easy with I'm just going to put the facts here as well.
Okay.
So on this one, you see, just listen to the track again.
I'm going to I'm going to add a spin transition, but it's transition with itself.
And to do that, I'm just going to bring back my premiere composer.
Don't forget, you can get this from your link in your course outline.
I'm just going to go to transition.
I'm going to go for a camera rotate and maybe a rotating hip boom, maybe clockwise.
And I'm going to leave that sound on a note on that beat.
Let's just edit it.
We'll put it to the first free the first two free video video tracks there.
And it's going to put the music at the sound effect that's just in and out there and clear that out
for my own mind.
I'll play that back
shake because we left that in because I kind of wanted to feel that I wanted the the beat to land.
But then looking back at it, I thought, Oh yeah, let's put something else.
So let's have a look back at that.
Look, this, this is close that this is such an easy way to be able to just make just a quick clip
collection with music, maybe social media or a teaser or anything.
And yeah.
It's good, isn't it?
Yeah.
Automate to a sequence.
It's such a great little tool in your kitbag.


### 28. Displacement Ripple Effect

So this is a bit of a niche effect.
However, the premise of it, it's a bit of a niche effect in this use, but the premise of it can be
used across so many different videos, types and effects now.
So yeah, it's a great one and it's another one that I love.
And so I brought in this footage and it's probably just really to I don't know what this may make me
feel better, but it's probably not going to because I haven't travelled for so long.
But with right click, you'll see what I mean.
Right click and new sequence from clip.
And just seriously what I wouldn't give to be doing that right now.
And it's this that we're looking at.
We're looking at the point where he hits the water because we want to kind of we want to effects this.
We want to kind of just make it more than what it is.
And this is this could this effect, although we're going for him diving into the water, nice straight
legs, well done.
And they might be bent, but it could be used for anything.
It could be like an impact.
Someone dropping down on a jump.
Or if it's a music video, it could be a beat on maybe the drums or like a strumming guitar or a crash
or a symbol, or even in a music video where it kind of tells something your slam adore or or anything
like that.
It's mainly in use for impact and emphasis.
So that's what this is.
That's what this is.
And it's effectively displacement ripple and it affects the whole video.
So how do we do this?
Well, first and foremost, we're going to duplicate that and we're going to right click and replace
with after effects composition because we're working in After Effects for this one.
And before we go any further, I need to address something in After Effects, and that is a plug in
that I haven't mentioned, which is completely 100% free, as long as you don't mind giving the company
your email address.
And they're brilliant, they're a great company.
They never get any spam from them and they're called video co-pilot.
And what I'm going to tell you to get and there's a link in the course outline and it's called effects
console or Effects Console.
And what it saves you doing is going up here and searching for something or a pair and searching for
an effect to apply just and a whole host of things.
And I'm going to show it now.
Let me just bring that in.
And it's called Effects Console.
Okay.
And the link in the course will bring you to this.
And all you have to do is download for what your on a PC or Mac hit the download that you want and then
we just take that down and it starts to download.
So I'm going to open this zip and say here, okay, I will buy it at some point and just double click
it and it brings up.
You probably couldn't see that, but it brings up just something to say.
Do you want to install a program that's trying to install you say Yeah, and you press I agree and this
is the 22 version.
So yeah, I want that and finish.
Let me just check.
Does that work now or do I need to restart?
I think I need to restart.
Come back in a second.
Okay.
Just restarted.
It is working and I'll show you it very soon.
So what are we doing?
Well, first and foremost, we're going to get rid of this guy as soon as I find out where we want to
be.
And that's right here.
What am I talking about?
Well, let's just create a solid and I'll tell you what we mean.
So if we right click here and go to new and solid, remember, a solid is just like in After Effects
in premiere pro new item and a column.
It's exactly pretty much the same.
So what we'll do is right click new and solid.
We're just going to have it as a white solid and we just going to call this repo although it's not it's
if I press enter it's a white solid but don't worry we'll get there.
So why have we got the play had at this point?
Well, if I just hide this for a moment, where at this point where he hits the water and this is where
I want to be to sort out where we're going to start this repo, which will then become a displacement
repo.
And it's at this point here.
So let me just turn back on this solid and just going to take down the opacity.
And to do that, remember, we just press t on the keyboard with the layer selected that we want and
then just drag that down.
You can drag it all the way down if you want, but I'm going to drag it down to about about 40% just
so we can see, because what we're going to do now is we're going to create a.
Mask.
And to do that, we're going to come up here and we're going to create an ellipse mask.
Now, this is a square.
Well, yeah, we can select square and start to draw a square.
Obviously, this is still the opacity that we've set.
It's absolutely fine.
But we don't want a square that's actually effectively a rectangle because it's freeform.
If you wanted a square, just hold on shift and it would go along the Y axis at the same rate as it
goes along the x axis, effectively creating a square.
The same works with an ellipse tool.
If we go with an ellipse tool here, if we just drag it out, we're creating a ellipse so rounded shape
of any kind of width and height.
However, if we hold down shift.
We create a perfect circle and that's what we want.
So I'm just going to create that.
Now here I'm going to come back to my selection tool and here is my ellipse.
But we want his hands right in the middle of the ellipse.
Now, the thing is, if I start to drag this now, we start to kind of change the shape of it, and
we don't want to do that.
So all we do is in a double click it.
And now not only do we have the the sizing.
Hold on.
Shift.
It gets it exactly how we want it.
Not only can we size it overall, but we also have this little guy.
And this is our anchor point.
As you can see, if I myself out, we have our anchor point.
If we got to here to a corresponding pan behind anchor point tool.
But what we're actually using this for is to gauge the center of this mask.
So I'm just going to drag this down right through his hands.
Okay.
That's all we need this for.
So now we're going to take the opacity all the way up, and we're going to hide this fella.
Just for now.
Don't worry.
He will be back.
The thing is, now that we've come out of this mask, you can see that actually the anchor point is
still appearance.
It's in the center of the main composition.
Doesn't matter.
We're not looking at that.
We're looking at the mask.
And if we double click this again, we get the center around here and that's what we care about.
So first, what we're going to do is we're going to size this up for the whole of the screen from the
center.
How do we do that?
Well, if we zoom out a little bit, you can also use the percentages here to go to like 12.5 or whatever.
You can also.
Don't forget, you can use the scroll wheel on your mouse if you have a mouse or the, you know, the
tracking or scrolling functionality of a trackpad is normally two fingers up or down to scroll in and
out.
And we're just going to size this up.
Now, if we grab this and start to pull.
We now come away from that center and we don't want to do that.
So with a mask, what we do is we hold down.
If we start to drag and we hold down control, we're now going out from the center, but we're going
out in an ellipse.
And we don't want to go out in an ellipse.
We want to go out in a perfect circle.
So while still holding control, hold shift and we now going out from the center and we just want to
go out enough to cover the whole screen, the whole window of composition.
Okay, so that's what we want.
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to mask this path.
Okay.
So I want to start from here.
This is my starting point.
I don't want anything else before it.
So, first and foremost, we're going to trim the beginning.
Now, what we can do is we can pull this all the way up like this, just like we would in Premiere Pro.
You know, it's kind of short in a clip from the end or from the beginning.
No, not that face.
Or we can also if I undo that, we can use the keyboard shortcut of alt or option on the Mac and the
left bracket square bracket now of the numbers.
But next to P and if we press the left bracket and alt or option, it trims from the beginning and it
doesn't move everything from the back to the beginning.
It just trims that beginning.
So that's where we want to start this mask.
Okay.
And what we want to do is I want to keyframe this mask.
So I need to get the mask path.
Easiest way to do that.
Remember, if we press on the keyboard, it brings up pop position with the layer selected.
If we press M brings back up the mask and it gives us our mask path and that's what we want.
So we're going to set a keyframe right there where they're going to go forward a little bit, maybe
to about here.
And then we're going to set another keyframe.
Okay.
So that's what we want it to go out to.
So now if we use this navigation and click back to the first keyframe, we're now going to size this
mask down.
And to do that, we double click it again while we can see it.
Obviously, what's highlighted on our layer selection.
Now we're going to hold down control and shift again and we're going to size this right down.
It doesn't matter where my mouse goes.
It's keeping a full, perfect circle.
Now, as we get really close, when it's kind of zoom in a little bit, so letting go of control and
shift on my mouse and my left mouse button.
Just going to zoom in a little bit.
Don't forget, you can use the spacebar and click and drag to drag everything around and just going
to continue to take it all the way down to like there.
I mean, it's tiny.
If we go back now to fit you can see over of course it just under a second.
We go all the way out.
Okay.
I want to make sure that that's right on that.
That's good.
And again, just like that.
And we're all the way out.
So that's the start of our mask.
But now we're going to use the mask to work against itself.
Okay.
Bear with me.
So this mask, we're going to duplicate this mask.
So with mask there.
Don't forget, if you've lost it and it's all closed up, just press em on your keyboard with the solid
or what we've renamed Ripple highlighted and or selected, and it will bring up this mask path.
We're going to click on Mask one and we're going to duplicate by holding control and D to duplicate.
Now we have mask two.
We want the mask path again.
So now with this selected, we want to see both mask paths.
And you can you can see here that there are keyframes, but we can't edit them because they're not fully
shown.
We're just being shown that there are keyframes we need to kind of get them.
So they're looking like this diamond again.
So if we press M, it'll close it up, press it again, and it opens out all masks on this path.
Okay, so now what we're going to do is I'm going to offset these two key frames.
Bear with me.
With this, it will all become very clear.
So if I now move this off a couple of frames, now you can see that this mask, the top mask, is already
growing by this point.
And this the duplicate of mask is following hot on its heels.
Okay, but we want this mask to be different to this mask.
I don't think I've ever said mask as many times in my life in one kind of statement, but it's worth
it.
So what we want to do is by default, a mask is at points at it.
It's in its default state of adding.
What we want to do is the second mask we want to subtract.
And because of the way that it's laid out, if we just drop this down and click subtract, we've now
got a ring rather than a full circle.
And now if we play this back.
It creates that effect.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Now.
It's still quite thick when we get towards the end, and I kind of don't really want that.
And the way in which we can affect that is if we take the last keyframe on the first on the first mask,
I'm stop putting that out.
As you can see, both the subtract mask and the adding mask get to the end at the same time.
So by the time we get to here.
It's just a thin little line going to drag on it just a little bit more, keep a little bit of thickness
and then we're out.
So play that again then.
That's good.
So that's the start of our ripple.
If we bring our fella back and play this game, play it back from here as he goes through, boom.
Now, actually, I think it's a little bit fat at that point.
I kind of want to I want the effect to start here.
I mean, like, you know, a bit chunky there.
So I kind of want to start at the start line again.
Boom.
Okay.
That's how I want it.
Now, if that's the effect that you want, it's not a displacement map, you know, that'll work for
you.
Go for it.
But we're going to go one step further and we're going to make this affect the whole scene, not just
by wiping a shape over it.
So the way in which we do this is we need to pre compose this.
So what we're going to do is we're going to pre compose this solid and that just means we can effect
it all together.
Okay.
So when a right click and we're going to pre compost and we're just going to call this ripple animation
kind of does what it says on the tin, doesn't it?
And we're going to move all attributes into the new composition.
One, all the attributes, all the masks, all the keyframes, everything inside it.
Don't open the new composition.
We don't need to do that.
Just press.
Okay, and that's done.
As you can see, it actually creates the full it creates the composition for the full length.
It's just kind of a default.
Because remember, when you create anything new on here in After Effects, it creates it for the full
duration.
I'm just going to shorten that up.
Remember, by hitting alt, holding down alt, don't hate it.
You'll break your keyboard, hold down alt on the left bracket and it just kind of closes it up.
That's fine.
It kind of still is running better underneath, but it's just saying I don't want it.
Okay.
And that's that.
And then what we're going to do is we're going to create an adjustment layer to important adjustment
layer is remember in Premiere Pro to put in context, if I just duplicate that out and create an adjustment
layer right click and adjustment layer press, okay, track this adjustment layer on here.
I remember what this does just for length.
Thank you very much.
And the adjustment layer effects anything below it.
So say where we've got the adjustment layer selected, we change up the exposure, maybe take down the
highlights, shadows, the saturation.
That's probably the worst collaborative ever done in my life, but that's only on the adjustment layer.
If I take away that you just want layer, it doesn't affect the clip.
So yeah, just, just remind you what adjustment layer is, just undo all that.
Go back to after effects and we're going to similarly you, you actually do it in the timeline.
You can do it up here somewhere, but right click on new and Adjustment Layer and we're now going to
rename this as our displacement map because that's what we're going to add onto here.
And this is where a console comes in.
And okay, we had to do a few clicks together installed and had to restart.
But from this point on, whenever you need anything like what I'm going to show you now, you don't
have to go up here or up to here and try and find it.
You just literally select what you want to add to.
So in this in this scenario, we've got our adjustment layer, which is called the displacement map.
And wherever your mouse pointer is, even if it's up here, it's going to bring up the console where
that is.
And if you all you have to do is hold down control and press spacebar and it brings up this.
Those are your Mac uses you'll understand spotlight so it's spotlight search it's kind of spotlight
search in after effects.
For those of you in Windows who don't know, you can get something called Powertoys.
It's not actually built in.
And if you press alt and spacebar, you get the exact same thing.
But in windows, but in here it's effects console and it's control and spacebar.
So what we're going to search for is a displacement map.
And just like that, it comes up in here and you just need to single click it.
You don't need to drag it on or anything, just single click it.
And it's now been applied to our adjustment layer called displacement map.
And what we need to do now is we need to select it, go to effects controls, and now we have this bit
of text in our effects controls.
So in our effects controls it defaults as the source is itself.
So we want to change that.
We want to change that to our ripple animation.
This is why it's really important to name your things just because it's just easy to find in dropdowns
dropdown and select ripple animation.
And with that done, what we want to do then is change what we want for the displacement.
We don't want it red and green.
Which is what?
The default is what we want is we want to select luminance because that's what we're going to be affecting
with this displacement map, reflecting the luminance of this and this ripple animation is now the source.
So if you select them both and select luminance, and then we're going to change our maximum horizontal
displacement to 30 and select 30 for the vertical as well.
Boom, done.
And now we have something that looks like this, which you can start to see that we've got something
happening, but it's not quite right.
And that's because we need to hide our animation.
And now if we play this back.
We have the effect.
How good is that once again?
Brilliant.
Now, those eagle eyed among you would have seen that as it's coming out.
It's kind of like a magnifier.
And as we're coming out, you can see that we've got these black bars and so that we have a little a
little tool that we use.
And we need to highlight our our clip because that's the clip that's being displaced.
And what we're going to do is we use what's called a motion tile.
So with that highlighted, we go for control and space again, again.
So it's easier and type in motion tile and literally just click it and it applies it.
And with that, rather than 100 in our width and height for the output, we just going to change that
to 150.
Nothing changes there because we're not at the width.
But if we go to the height and press 150.
Have a look down here.
If I press enter.
Now we're kind of covering that in, but it's still not the right color.
If we hit mirror edges.
Boom.
What does that do?
Well, what's actually happening behind is it's mirroring.
So this is being tiled.
So you see this color up here.
That's the colour down here.
And you see the colour up here.
That's the colour down there.
But if we mirror the edges, we fill them in.
So the top is reflective against itself.
So if you imagine this is duplicated and flipped above itself and the bottom is duplicated above itself.
If I grab this and press scale and start to size it down, you can see what I mean.
See how this is there and up there.
And yeah, you see how the buttons are being.
The button at the top of the end reflects against itself.
It's just a little trick.
And if we play that back now.
I pressed zero on the keyboard, by the way, and the number pad.
It just it's kind of a pre-rendered, but it kind of plays in pre render live time.
And I love this effect.
It's just so good.
Just.
Boom.
And because we place it there right at the beginning.
And if I bring this back, you can see what's being read.
See here.
That's why we kind of placed it right at that point.
And if you play through slowly, you can see that we're actually it's like a magnification of that bit.
Now, if you don't necessarily want the harsh, harsh lines here, then it's really quite simple.
All we do is we turn this back on so we can see it.
Double click to come back in and on our ripple, on our masks, obviously, our press M2, that's the
masks.
If we press if it brings our mask feather.
Okay.
And watch the edges.
Now, as we track, these are just going to drag that.
And that affects the top because it's affecting the outside edge, because this doesn't know that it's
got an inside edge because it's being cut out.
So now we need to feather the second mask, which is a subtract mask, which is going into.
The first mask, and now we've got a kind of feathered edge.
If we now close it, we don't have to close it, but close that now and then hide it again.
We come back.
Now you see how it's almost like a wave there.
I play it back now.
I may have felt a little bit too much, but can you see what's.
Happening there.
Oh, actually, that looks quite good.
I like that.
I love it.
Okay, great.
Now we can take this one step further if we wanted to.
Okay, just if we wanted to.
I'm not saying you have to, but if we now if we get these two and press em on our keyboard and obviously
we have our mask, if we select a mask one, unmasked two, and by holding control and then we press
control D again, we've now created mask three and four.
If we grab them while they're both selected and drag them down, we have three and four here.
Okay.
Now, as you can see, we have our keyframes, but you can't quite see them going to press M and then
M again, so we can see them all.
And if we offset this even further, you've now got.
To lots of it.
See how that's going through that?
Yeah.
If you control an aspect, come back and see how that's affected it.
You see how it goes again?
We come back.
We're kind of doubling the thing, but you see how it creates it over and over again.
You know what I'm going to do, don't you, in control and ask that to save it and come back to Premiere
Pro because I always rely on Premiere Pro to do a decent pre rendering and I certain point there and
hold control and enter I'll let the pre render and look in that back again.
We have a double displacement.
Going straight through such such a great effect.
I absolutely love it.
It's brilliant.
I don't forget, you know.
I mean, we feathered these and just kind of give it more of a ripple.
I probably want to do that because it's water.
If you don't necessarily want to feather those edges, if you don't want it as much of a ripple, you
can just leave them harsh.
Take off that feathering and it'll be absolute definite.
But yeah, that is your displacement ripple effect.
Absolutely.
Love it.


### 29. Sketch to Video Effect

So this effect is quite a nostalgic one.
And if anyone remembers the music video by A-ha Take On Me, it kind of it it kind of feels a little
bit like this I love this effect and I think used correctly can ad tonight it's just it's just really
nice it's lovely.
So first and foremost we need some footage and I got this clip from Art Critic.
I love this.
This clip is a really nice moment.
It's kind of starts where she's having a photo taken and that's kind of going to be the start for us.
I'm going to right click and create a new sequence from the clip.
Zoom in.
And although it is, it's only a 5/2 clip.
You know, as much as I do, just how that doesn't really matter.
It doesn't matter at all.
We're going to work with this.
And secondly, what we need is an image and I've already looked in motion, Ray, and I found this image
which I quite like if I tell the rest it's this.
And obviously you can see this is square and the actual video isn't perfect.
This image is square, but the note end, but we're going to make that work as well.
So I'm just going to click download and within seconds we now have it here ready for us.
Make up for love.
If I double click that, you can see it right here.
Lovely.
Okay, so how do we start?
Well, let's ignore the note for now at the love letter.
And we're just going to we're going to concentrate on this and find a point where we kind of want to
start.
I think it's a few it's maybe a few frames in a way.
She's really smiling.
You can probably hear me smile in looking at that because she really is.
She's smiling.
It's lovely.
So we're going to select this clip.
Oh, we're going to look there.
Now, remember, we've used we've used a way to freeze time before.
Well, what I want to do is I want to create an instance where everything from this point before is
freeze frame.
With this frame.
Now, the easy way to do this, obviously we've created a frame pause before going forward.
But with this created and the play head right here, if we right click this and go to frame hold options
we select hold on source timecode and because we've got this click clip selected and we right click
to that clip if we press okay if we now go back, this is held still and then the rest of it carries
up.
Okay, it's going to get rid of that for now.
We're just working with this.
Obviously, we can make this as long or short as we want.
Let's make it about this long.
Just just to give us some room.
We're going to move this up onto the first video track and then we're going to bring in bass.
And we're bringing this actually in right there for now, because I want to size this up and we're going
to with this selected click effects controls and make sure it's selected.
It was put through and it does that.
Oh, it's going to size this up a little just so it's fully in.
And I actually want this piece of paper to be centered, so we're going to bring that up a little bit
on the Y-axis as well.
And that's good for me.
Okay, get rid of those.
I'm just going to bring this behind.
So now we want to fit this image into or onto the piece of paper.
So first off, we're going to drop the opacity so we can kind of see through this, as you can see there.
And then we're going to start to scale down just so we're looking for top and bottom.
I'm going to have to probably start rotating a little bit as well to try and make it correct there.
You don't have to be absolutely spot on because we're going to mask this out as well, but maybe take
the scale down a little bit more and kind of look that up.
Yeah, kind of want to rotate it just a little bit more.
We're going to click and say maybe minus six.
Okay, maybe minus seven.
I'm looking at this bottom edge here, minus seven.
Press enter.
Okay, that looks like yeah, it's right the way across.
It's going to move it.
I'm going to click actually motion.
I'm going to move it myself now because I know that the the rotation is pretty much spot on and yeah,
that's going to do for now.
Good.
Okay.
We're going to leave that opacity down and we're just going to mask this out.
Again, we don't have to be too accurate, but I'm actually going to take the opacity a little bit further
down so I can really see this note.
And like we've done before, we're going to grab the pen to remember how we did it with the with the
walking or the swiping mask.
And I'm going to tell you this so we can see it better.
I'm also going to drop it to about 75 now.
It's about 52.
So I've got some room to move and we still got the pen tool selected.
So we're just going to you can see actually we're not quite op at the.
Actually, let me just tell that out and come back.
Get rid of the pen till they're back in.
And I'm just going to move it up just a little bit.
Just just just to that.
Obviously, we're off about my hair a little bit, but we're right the way up the top, which is where
I think matters.
Tilt it out again.
Just come back in with the pencil.
No, go back in there.
Creates another one.
Let's just undo that.
Maybe delete that mask.
Let's go for that.
Now, hit the pencil and that's till the end.
And let's get this party started.
So this is just nice.
Four points.
We're going to click there.
Click the.
Click there and click there.
Good.
And I was just going to join them up.
And that one, that mascot, everything else.
Good.
That's good.
Start.
And let's tell the back out and fit.
I can get rid of these now because I'm not using any more and we can just make this a little bit bigger.
So now we're going to bring the opacity all the way back up to 100.
Click out so we can see where we're at.
I'm just going to feather this mask a little bit.
Just.
Just a little bit.
Good.
That's a good start.
We're actually covering the pencil, but don't worry, we will sort that out.
First off, we're going to apply some effects to this.
And the first effect we're going to apply is find edges.
So if you go into effects and type find and there's find that just going to drop that straight out our
clip and straight away you'll see that all of a sudden it's starting to look almost like a drawing because
what it starts to do is it finds the edges, lets see the pieces of contrast and that's kind of that's
a good start.
It is a good start.
If we invert, you can say kind of like what that would mean.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, good.
So now if that's not obviously in this circumstance, it's not quite right.
And if yours works and it looks fine by then, great.
It already is starting to look like a drawing.
But we've got color in here and I kind of want to more make it more like a sketch.
So we go to the color and just like we would with a video clip, we just use the mitre to kind of just
play around with it, first of all, to kill out all the saturation.
Then I'm going to maybe boost the contrast a little bit, see if we can get some more in, maybe drop
the shadows, maybe drop the whites, maybe.
No, we don't do that.
Maybe drop the blacks a little, maybe drop the exposure ever.
So.
Now, that doesn't work for us.
Maybe boost the contrast.
Take down the there we go.
And sometimes when you take up the contrast, it works.
Sometimes if you take it down, it works and good.
That looks okay to me.
What's going to make it really sell is when we get these things back, the hearts here and the pencil
here.
So that's what I'm going to do now.
I think that's that's enough for me.
I think maybe if we wanted to do anything, Masque expansion might help.
Now, if we go up from zero, we can go up or down.
So if we go up, it takes the mask out.
But if we go down, we can bring the mask in, see how it's going in there if we bring it.
So maybe about.
And maybe about that, that sounds a little bit better for me.
COATES Get these out.
And that's what we're going to do next.
Good.
So we're happy so far.
Yeah.
Say yes.
Hello.
Good.
Okay.
Now, what we could do is we could take this image and take it into Photoshop, and it would be really
quite easy to get out.
But I want to kind of stay in.
I want to stay in Premiere Pro for this.
So I'm going to grab this and hold down alt and drag it up.
And now we've got a clean slate of this.
So all we really want to do is I want to get this heart and the shadow and I want to get this pencil
and the shadow.
The problem with that is the fact that these are four different things.
So we're going to need four of these.
That makes sense, but duplicate.
So we're going to grab the first one and I'm actually going to rename this as a pencil shadow.
And there's a reason why I'm starting with pencil shadow because the pencil shadow will come underneath
the pencil.
It might not really matter, but just in case it does that, we're going to duplicate that up there.
I'm going to rename this as pencil and then I'm going to alt and duplicate this up again and right click
this and rename changes down there.
We're going to say heart.
Shadow.
I forgot the word for shadow.
Let's leave it alone.
I'm going to duplicate it last time.
Right click and rename.
It Has Hot.
Good.
So first off, we're going to start with the heart.
And first off, I'm going to select the bottom three and select them.
And I'm going to grab our Pento because we're going to mask around this heart.
Now, if we just quickly remind ourselves, if I disabled this one as well, you can see that the top
of the heart is actually in shot.
It's only the bottom half that we kind of need to think about.
So that's good to bear in mind.
So we don't have to go all the way around the heart mess about.
With that, I'm going to show you I'm going to show you first how long it takes in Premiere Pro and
then I'm going to show you how easy it will be if you take it to Photoshop.
Yeah, I think I think that's for me, that's the best way to show you because at least I'm showing
you both ways in case you want to add another program to your arsenal.
And obviously we've done a lot in after effects, but then again, there's an easy parallel between
those two.
But yeah, it's always good to kind of play a little bit in Photoshop as well.
Anyway, we're going to start with this.
I'm going to get the heart.
So first off, we're going to go into our opacity and click the pen tool there, which creates a mask.
Now what we're going to do is we're going to first well, we're going to tilde this.
So we've got a bit more and that's probably enough.
We don't need to zoom in anymore.
Remember, we've got all of this heart to the top half kind of there.
So we're just going to click there, click.
They're going to come around here.
It's a little bit of a bend there.
So when I do that and then we're going to do that and that's our heart back.
Don't forget, with all these handles and all that, check out your pulse outline for the Betsy a tool
game trainer thing.
It's brilliant, but tilt out of here.
If I click out, we can see that that heart is now there.
If we disable this, you can see we've now brought it back.
I'm just going to feather this.
Well, actually, there's already a bit of a feather on there if a feather too much, actually.
Now we'll leave it at ten.
That's absolutely perfect.
And now we're going to bring in the hot shadow, which obviously covers everything up again.
So again, we're going to come here with the tool, the pencil in the opacity tilde on here.
And we don't need to worry about the heart, just need to worry about the opacity.
However, everything will become clear as to why I've gone for a separate layer for our for our shadow.
Just going to click in here just so we've got everything and boom, that's that done come out here.
And if we click out it's quite rough, isn't it?
Okay, so I'm going to show you why.
I'm just going to feather that just a little bit.
So that makes it a little bit more, I don't know, shadowy.
And we could change our blending mode.
But actually if we just turn down the opacity of this layer to 40%, watch this hit.
Enter boom.
Looks like a shadow.
See it.
It's hardly there if I select it and disable it.
But it's those little things that help to sell it.
And with the pen and with the pencil and the shadow, it will sell even more.
So let's bring on the pencil, which I see again brings on everything going to go for a pencil and the
opacity and we will just repeat.
So down from the bottom.
Up to there, maybe up to the tip right there and then down here and boom, boom, done, closed up
that tilt out and it gets a little bit repetitive.
Now I'm just going to feather this by about maybe 15.
Click out and see maybe a feather that little bit too much.
Leave it at ten maybe.
Yeah, quite happy with that.
That's all good.
But we don't have the shadow.
See?
See, we need that shadow.
So can I bring that.
I'm going to press there again zero to enable it and we're then going to do one last opacity mask on
the shadow and just need to come round.
There may be a little bit like that, bearing in mind we're going to drop found the opacity of this
one so it doesn't really matter too much and click there and then boom done.
It looks awful once it first comes, isn't it?
And then we're going to take that opacity hit 40 boom.
And now we have our shadow and we are laughing.
Looks good, doesn't it?
I hope you think so.
I can't hear you.
But I'd like to think that you're.
You're saying it looks good.
So how would we do that in.
In Photoshop?
Well, really quite easily, actually.
Let me get this image again.
I'm just going to duplicate this.
In fact, you don't need to do that.
I can just duplicate this, which is the full image there.
And what we do is we do right click and edits in Adobe Photoshop.
And now this is actually going to overwrite this JPEG.
So we need to label it correctly because we don't want to affect everything else.
But yeah, we just open it up in Photoshop.
It automatically loads it in and we are now here in Photoshop.
We were to double click the background.
Don't worry, I'm not going to go into absolute minor detail with regards to this, but what we're going
to do is we're going to create a mask for the for things of the heart, the and just bring this down
to orbit so you can see the heart, the shadow, the pencil and the shadow.
Okay, so that's all we're going to do.
And to do that, we're going to first select our layer here and control J and just kind of luck this
one.
So we're not touching it.
And what I'm going to do is we go for a clipping mask and I'm going to go I'm going to switch to black,
have my brush on here.
And whenever I paint now you can't see at the moment because I've got that like like an idiot.
Turn that off and lock it now.
And you can see I'm painting transparency.
If I was black on black and white because I'm working on this clipping mask.
Okay.
So now going to size it up by holding alt and right click and I'm just going to paint it around here.
We could use the pen tool again, but I'm not going to.
We don't really need any of this at all, just really matter to us because actually we're only keeping
part of the pencil and all that.
But if we clear out all this.
And we get to a point where we're all good.
It's just this just kind of gives us a better starting point.
And now I'm going to.
Play.
Okay.
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to come to a selection tool and the magic select the quick
selection tool is here.
If you if it doesn't look like this, it probably will look like this.
But if it does just a long press with your left mouse button and you select quick selection tool and
again with alt and right, right mouse button be kind of you can resize your selection.
I'm just going to click this guy.
So that's now clicked and selected the whole of the heart pretty much.
And if we just click again we can go and we've now got that lovely shadow.
And with that selected, all I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my brush and if I leave that
selected like that, if I go through, I'm only removing what's in the selection.
However, if I controls the controls that come out of that and go selects an inverse, I'm now select
and now get rid of everything that's outside of that selection.
And all I'm going to do now is I'm going to kind of fade out this this shadow, but I'm going to make
it on its own layer.
But if I look down here, you can see that there are certain points that aren't quite out.
So I'm just going to come back to my my black brush.
I'm looking down here and just making sure I get all the way through here and.
Good.
So I'm going to layer I'm going to call this I'm going to duplicate this first control J to duplicate
it.
I'm going to double click this and I'm going to call this heart just like we did in in Premiere Pro.
But as you can see, the tools in here are so much more powerful.
I want to turn that off for now.
I'm going to control J again and I'm going to double click in here and just say heart shadow.
Okay, so now I'm going to turn this light off.
I'm just working on the heart and I'm going to come back here.
I'm still working on the clipping mask.
I've got that highlighted.
I'm just going to come here.
I'm just going to get rid of most of that shadow.
I want a bit of it a little bit, but not too much.
And I'm just going to just so blends properly and that works for me.
Good.
Now I'm going to turn back on the heart shadow, turn off the heart and I'm going to work again in the
clipping mask and I'm going to get the half the Harkness up and down while holding alt and the right
mouse button affects the hardness going side to side.
It changes the diameter.
So I'm just going to take the hardness to about there.
I'm just going to get rid of this hard.
Okay, get rid of it.
Still got a bit underneath, but that's cool.
And now I'm just going to get this hot shadow.
Just select it and take the filter down to about.
We said 40 before and I see it's got 41 will do.
And those are those two then done and that opacity will continue.
Okay, so now let's just hide those two.
I was just going to do the same with this one.
If we zoom out, we've now got these on first and foremost.
Before I start duplicating it, I'm working on the clipping mask and I'm going to get rid of the heart
completely, and then I'm going to duplicate this by control and J.
I'm going to call this pencil shadow.
Enter double click this say pencil, hit enter.
That's pencil.
That's not how you spell pencil.
Good.
Get rid of the A.
Thank you.
And let's just hide the pencil for now.
I just want to keep the pencil shadow.
So, again, what we're going to do is going to come here with this brush, size it down, and we're
just going to not do that, going to select the actual clipping mask, and we're going to get rid of
most of the pencil.
Okay.
Most of the pencil.
Most of it come around here.
We don't need any of this.
I'll come up here with a brush.
Just around here all the way along.
Good.
And then we're going to get there and we're going to say again, we're going to go 40% boom.
Done.
Just a hint of it with the pencil.
Doesn't really matter.
Then come back here, close that off.
And then we're going to use the selection tool again.
And we're on the actual clipping mask of the pencil and we're going to just click, okay, that's good.
I expected more, but okay, let's just move it down.
Let's move down all the way down here.
And then we can refine.
Here.
Okay, so we're all good here.
In a bit more of the pencil here.
As you can see, this, these used to be called marching ants around here.
Now we've got the pencil here, but we've got a little bit here that we don't need.
And we've got all this that we don't need.
So what we do is we pull down Alt and we click that to close it up.
That's good.
Click.
That's close up and then starts with alt health.
Kind of start getting rid a little bit.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Thank you.
Don't need you.
Don't need you, that's all.
Got a bit more of that pencil and you could have come around here with the pencil, but the selection
tool is so good in them in Photoshop.
And again with the clipping my selected if we hit our brush, if we've got black selected over here,
if we go through, we're getting rid of what's selected.
But you already know if we go to select an inverse control shift, I is a shortcut and go around it.
We're now painting everything outside of here.
Get rid of all that.
Get rid of all that pain happy done control d to d select Turn on all bets and hold on Let's get rid
of the pencil.
Get rid of the pencil and.
Okay.
We don't want that.
This is all still here from before.
So this is what is being shown.
So let's turn that up and get rid of that, because we're all black over here.
Turn that back on.
Turn that off.
And we want to work on the clipping mask again.
Get rid of all that.
And boom, boom, boom.
Done.
Happy cam, however.
See something right there?
Which layer is that on there is on the Pennsylvania.
Good.
Happy.
I'm gonna get rid of all this.
Dunno which layers they're on but doesn't really matter.
So what we now want to do is we want to export it at the right size and the right resolution.
So we got to file, go to export, export as we don't want our image size, we want our canvas size.
And to get that right, we come back to Premiere Pro, we go to our sequence and check our sequence
settings and we're looking for 1496 by 2160 compacts for Photoshop and type in here, 1496 click out
by 21, 60 click out.
Let that do its thing.
It will only export.
And so it's done this thing anyway.
That looks about right and hit export.
You can change the name if you want to, but I'm just going to export.
Actually gives me the option to rename it here.
So I will.
So I'm just go to images in here.
I'm going to click in here.
I'm just going to say sketch overlay, hit enter and now that will save out.
And then all we have to do is come back into here.
The easy way to get to where these are, which is kind of in the area, is reveal an explorer.
And if we go back to emotion array assets, we save it in our images, click it images.
And where is it?
It's there in our sketch overlay and we grab our sketch overlay, drag it into here.
How long does it feel that we're playing with the picture overnight and then we just let's get over
here.
This is what we want to cover over because we set all that correctly.
Once we drop it in, boom, we are done and dusted.
How good does that look?
And it's just in one PNG that's going over it.
Good.
Now that we got that, let's move on.
And all we need to do now is we need to highlight all of these and we now need to nest these and we're
going to call this sketch and that's that done.
And then if we just play that now, hey, looks good, doesn't it?
But what I want to do is I want to kind of make it so it looks real.
So he kind of going into her as she becomes real and the way in which we do this is we're just going
to over like this and we're just going to turn down the opacity of this first.
And then if we bring our position, I'm just going to drop that opacity a little bit more.
Maybe it's 40%.
40% is our opacity today, isn't it?
And we're just going to size up this image.
I'm going to look at her eye, her ear there.
I'm just going to take back that rotation.
Just down a bit too far.
I hate the rotation thing.
Okay, that kind of looks it.
If I play that now, if I take that of that opacity.
Yeah.
Okay, that looks cool.
So that doesn't look right, though, does it?
No, it doesn't.
Because we change the position, the scale and the rotation swap going to do is we're going to get to
here and we're going to set a keyframe position, scale rotation.
Okay.
Then we're going to come back and then we're going to reset, reset, reset.
And we're going to right click and ease out and select all them.
Right click is in.
So now we have this effect that doesn't look quite right, does it?
Because we've now got this at the bottom.
So what we need to do is we need to do a little bit of zooming of our own.
Or do we?
Maybe not.
You know why?
I'm going to duplicate this and I'm going to take this bottom, this bottom layer.
I'm just going to get rid of all these key frames.
So as you can see, when this starts to rotate, color stays the same.
And there's no problem, because if I get rid of this, it's still the same underneath and that color
is continued.
Good.
Nice little trick going in there.
Good.
So now what I want to do is I want to make it a little bit longer.
So I'm going to go maybe about here.
I need to go into one of these and make the clips longer inside.
If I didn't, we'd just undo that and go back.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to make these nests bigger.
But because this is a duplicate of this duplicate, even if this by double click and I highlight both
of them, in fact, I need to highlight all of them and then drag them out.
If I select all of these and then drag them out, I can drag them out as long as I want because they're
all single images or yes, static images.
So if we come back here, we can now drag these two out because they're both the same thing.
Good.
Happy with that?
And I know that whenever this is in here, we want these these key frames.
So if I'm going to take this over maybe a little bit like this and click here, I'm now going to drag
these key frames over to here at that point, maybe drag these maybe all the way back to the beginning.
Let's see how that looks.
And it's just.
Nice.
Good.
Okay.
I want to ask a little bit longer than a Y.
I just want it a little bit longer.
Let's take it to about.
Okay.
I need to go further inside the nest.
Good.
Done.
And make it a little bit longer.
Good.
I'm going to go to here and I'm going to grab these key frames and drive them right the way to the end.
That should be like a nice, slow movement.
And just ease and boom, we've got her.
And now all we're going to do is we're going to add just a little bit of a something something.
And that is from premiere composer.
And because this is kind of like a nostalgic thing, I'm going to do a lightly almost like a like a
dream sequence.
So in transitions we'll go down to the light leaks organic and you know, my favorite one it's this
one because it's got the warmth in it as well here at the play had.
Is that the right point?
Adds.
It adds, it added.
I'm going to go to the end here the beginning there and control and enter just to pre render this.
And if we now play this back going to get rid of that.
I'm going to tilde that out actually and let's watch this together.
Beautiful.
Really nice.
It's a lovely effect.
It's a great way to start maybe a holiday video or reminiscence video.
It's just.
Lovely.
Now, the problem that we do have there is that as we come out here, we've got these bars.
These bars are being created because this isn't the right size.
Size up this adjustment layer just a little, just so it kind of covers everything.
If we go over here just to check, that's not there as well.
It's not staying.
Correct.
So we just need to size that up as well.
Okay.
We go all the way out.
Just prevent.
Do that again.
You don't often have these problems with premiere composer, but when you do, they're so easily changed
because these are effectively adjustment layers and.
Do we have it?
The sketch to video effect.


### 30. Title Blur Effect

In this chapter, we're going to learn how to make this text effect for ourself.
There's much more going on than what May 1st meet the eye, but learning the techniques in this chapter,
how to create this effect, well then stand is in good stead to be able to not only reuse this, however
we want with whatever text we want and whatever font.
But moving on will be working out how to use this across multiple projects again and again and again.
Let's get into it.
First off, the blur text effect.
Now, up until now most well actually all typography that is kind of animating arm.
We've used premiere composer predominantly and why wouldn't you.
I mean we've got.
Loads and loads and loads of different types of text that we can just drag in and edit.
Well, this is say a, a ready meal, a microwave meal, a TV dinner depending on where you live in
the world.
A meal that's ready for you that you just need to either reheat in the microwave or in the oven.
And while it depends on where you've bought it from, a ready meal can be really quite good quality.
It's not it's just it's not the same as making it from scratch and making something from scratch, like
some form of text.
Animation can not only make it more yours, as it were, but you also then learn more techniques to
then be able to apply them.
So you've got that ready meal, but the ready meal doesn't really come with any sides.
Well, if you know how to do maybe dolphin y potatoes, you can do them on the side so it can they can
complement each other.
You can tell I'm really into my food.
By the way, if you've never had dolphin was potatoes and you like cream and garlic, well, you need
to look at that.
You really do.
In fact, let me just start and you secrets from this.
And just to be absolutely clear dolphin was is spelt something like that.
Central graphics change your colour and make that bigger baby.
No and this you can select the text on the why you would have to do that.
Make it black and just make it big.
Dolphin was a I'm pretty sure that's spelt wrong, but if you put into Google, Google will tell you
how to spell it.
It was potatoes, potato.
A dolphin was it's a French dish.
Anyway, I digress and yeah.
And so if we kind of if we're going down the whole idea of food and ready meals and doing it for yourself
or buying it or the N or a takeaway or going to a restaurant, what we're going to do in this section
is, yeah, okay.
It's quite, it's quite detailed.
However, what we're doing here is really creating something that can stand is in good stead going forward.
So if there's not the ready meal that you're looking for, not quite right.
And you think, well, actually, if I spend some time, I can make it myself.
That's what we're trying to inspire today.
So what we're going to do is we're going to create this animation.
And then while we've done that and this is kind of the main reason why I want to do this, I want to
then kind of introduce you into maggots, emoji art or motion graphics templates.
And in this you can you can make anything, you can make those things.
So we've got two extensions and premiere composer again, these effectively are motion graphics templates,
all the typography, it's all motion graphics templates.
And you know, when you drag this on, you put it in and you've got once it does actually get in and
we get to the edit point, there's all these different parameters that we can change within this motion
graphics template.
So we come into here and we've got the text on here, we can move the position, we can move the scale,
we can change the fonts, not probably to that.
And you can, you can change loads of things.
Well, what happens if you wanted to change the well actually this tracking here so we can track it
out to that kind of thing.
But maybe what?
That wasn't in there.
And you wanted to include it or you wanted to include say it's on two lines and you wanted to easily
change the space between the two.
Well, you can create something that is going to allow you to do that, and that's what we're going
to be covering today.
It's a whole load.
This chapter is going to be absolutely jam packed with new technique.
So if you're not ready for that, I would maybe go and have a coffee, have a lie down, come back.
But that's what we're going to be doing here.
So first and foremost, we don't have to take our footage into after effects.
We've got to build it in after effects.
But the reason why this works and is so important is that what we're going to be doing is kind of it's
a round robin between after effects and premiere composer.
And once it's done, you're just say a premiere composer, premiere pro.
But once it's done, all you're ever really going to be living in is the essential graphics tool, which
is generally over here.
These are motion graphics templates.
I think I've made my point anyway, right click and let's replace with after effects and I'm just going
to call this in Into
the wild just so I've got just to call it anything really.
Okay.
So let's start as we mean to go on.
We need to first create some text and I'll only and Molly going to bring in things when you need to
know them.
I hope that's clear.
So if you start to question, don't worry.
If you can't see something, don't worry.
We will be getting on it.
But first and foremost, this footage, I mean, seriously, how beautiful is this footage?
I think it's absolutely gorgeous.
Just some of the footage that you can get these days with a decent quality, John.
It's just it's just stunning, isn't it?
So let's get on with it.
And the first thing we need to do is create our text.
So right in after effects, we just come straight to the title, click in here.
It will make us a little layer across the bottom and always say, we just put in our text, we're going
to call this into the wild.
Maybe not well spelled Bartley Wild.
And the thing is with After Effects is it always obeys the last thing you had in.
So we've got no esta shocker and we've got this, this colour that we had before.
So we're just going to change this.
I'm going to change this to White.
There we go.
We just had to do that simply by having the text selected.
I'm going to change this text because for something like this I think we need Nexa.
I love Nexa.
Next light is a beautiful, beautiful piece of typeface.
I'm also going to force capsules there.
I love that, love it.
I'm just going to size it up and you'll see I've not done anything.
I've not put it in the right place yet.
And that's because with text on it after effects, you can change.
The default for the default level really kind of sticks for me and the anchor point is always at the
bottom middle kind of.
We could then get that to center.
Don't forget, we've got our wing anchor point mover and I always have this.
This comes as free as the bundle with our base animation composer.
Don't forget link in your course outline and we can easily send to this actually by you see this anchor
point move.
We can come here and we can drag it round.
If you double click this, it takes it into the center.
If I come off here, it's your whole control.
Thank you.
Hold on.
Control and double click and it brings it into the middle.
However, one is, once you start moving things again, see how the anchor point doesn't move.
It's really annoying.
So I just literally I use my anchor point move out and just done that goes in the middle.
So we're going to center this firstly, we're going to sense the texts already sent it good.
And then in the line which is going to center it there and center there, boom, done.
And sometimes it kind of does take a bit of time to catch up and I'm happy with that.
Am I?
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe size it down just a little bit.
And this is where we have the problem because watch, we're in the center here.
We start to size it down.
Now, the anchor point kind of stays where it was.
It's really annoying, but it's fine.
We can just boom and done.
It's important to have it in the center because this is the kind of text that we're going to have in
the center.
But you will see when we get much further in that we can move that easily.
But okay, one, one step at a time.
So whether you realize or not, I absolutely love delving down into the kind of the underbelly that
is all this kind of thing.
So I hope you enjoy this tutorial because there's loads of little minutia and intricate things, but
I think it's brilliant.
I've just changed my mind actually.
I'm going to put it into small caps.
So all caps does all this.
If you don't know this with typography, if you do small caps wherever you selected a capital, it's
a big capital.
Whatever is lowercase is kind of small caps.
Actually, I don't like that.
Now I'm going to go back to all capitals.
Good.
I'm glad we had that story.
So let me just to hide this.
It's going to hide this for out just so we can see it in perfect detail.
And what we're going to do is everything that we're doing to this text is in these parameters underneath
here.
Now, if you think about it, all we've done in the past is maybe P for position, the scale T for opacity
or transparency.
But if you close it up and open it up, we have so many of the things now what every single layer has
is the transform.
So we've got our anchor point.
You've got a position scale rotation in opacity.
By the way, if you press R on your keyboard, that's rotation.
Just to give you all the shortcuts for all of these down here is anchor point.
Oh, it is.
Never use that before you start over.
Check that out.
So it's AP s, r and t opacity just being awkward.
So we're not going to be using our transform, we're going to be using our text.
And once we've clicked this down, now you see that we have an option for source text.
There's actually a keyframe there, don't we?
We're not going to use and that's fact.
We have our path options.
We also have more options.
Do not get worried.
I will be stepping through this nice and slowly.
So first and foremost, what we're going to do and what we need to do is we want to add on something
to this layer.
And if you look here with text open, we have this new button and it gives the option to animate.
And then there's a play button.
What this play button is, although it doesn't look like it's actually a dropdown menu or drop up if
you down into the bottom.
What we're going to do is we're going to add a blur.
And now, as you can see, we've added an animator and a range selector and a blur.
So follow me.
Follow me.
Little bit blindly here into the wild, as it were.
And we've added an animation, which is the blur.
We now want to animate the animation, which is the Blur.
Bear with me.
Just do what I'm doing.
Click on Add.
Now we've animate here, which is a kind of hidden dropdown you see up here.
What we can do is going to click on this one and we want to add a property and that property is opacity
property.
It will all become clear.
So before we go any further, we just need to blur this.
So in our blur we can just maybe type in 50 and press enter and that we've blurred this out a little
bit.
And now what we want to do is if we drop down our range selector and drop down advanced, come down
here.
And what we want to do is we want to play around with the offset.
So if we if we look at this, this is the offset for the range selector.
And if you look here, we've got a line here now and a line here.
Now, if we start to drag up this offset, we start to see that we're offsetting the blur.
Okay.
So that's okay.
Don't worry.
We're kind of getting there.
It's starting the effects now.
So I brought this offset of just to kind of show you.
Let's just take that back to zero.
You can either do that or click in and type zero or right click and reset does exactly the same thing.
And if we look down here in our advanced, we need to change a couple of things in case we need to change
the shape to ramp up.
So as you can see, we're starting to add a ramp.
We have a number of different kinds of ramps that we've touched on, speed ramps in in Premiere Pro
and remember a speed ramp.
If I just quickly come up here and it does look like a speed ramp, if I go show clip frames, time
wrapping and speed and go in there and then start to pull that down and then pull that out.
But that was a speed ramp.
And what this graphic is showing you is we're going from this to this and the time in which it takes
to get from this speed to this speed is this ramp here.
So that's the first introduction of a kind of ramp.
What we also have is kind of a gradient ramp, which is what this is, which is complete to nothing.
That's what we're doing because we're ramping the actual blur.
Okay.
Now, the more we want to do to get the effect that we're looking for is to randomize order.
So you see this off.
You just click it and it clicks on.
And now you're starting to see the start of our kind of random thing of blurring in or blurring the
effect.
Okay.
Our own random speed zero, which is fine for now.
There are so many different randoms just then, but I mean, let me just take that.
We've turned on a randomised order.
Okay.
But a randomised order, if we're going to be able to change, it has to have a set number of values.
So we have to have a version of random because to us it's random.
But to the actual software it's not.
It says, okay, if this by this firebase followed by this, followed by this.
Whereas in maybe random seed one it's this or that.
Followed by this.
Followed by that, followed by them.
But do you understand what I mean?
So you can actually change the randomizing of it?
I know, I know.
So we've got that and we've got it all working there, but nothing is happening.
And that's because we've got everything at a and a at a state right now.
And that state is a random order with a ramp up on a range selector of a blur.
Next up to start this working is we need to start key framing the offset.
Okay.
So right here in the offset of the range selector wants a keyframe back.
And let's set that sum -100.
So click in type -100, press enter and we go completely blurred.
Okay, we have our keyframe here.
Let's move it along.
I think maybe about 2 seconds is good for this kind of animation.
And then we set another keyframe.
I'm going to zoom in here just a little bit, just kind of give us a bit more kind of visual on these
two keyframes.
This is still only 2 seconds between, and we're going to take this and put it to a hundred boom done
in.
Remember, the default was zero.
So now if we take this back to the beginning and play it in.
We now randomizing in to those letters, and that's kind of the start of our innovation.
Looks good.
Okay.
So now we can go further with this now, because as you can see, even though it's blurred, it's completely
visible.
And what we need to do is we now need to start to play with the opacity.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get the opacity down here, right here in the range selector
again, going to toggle that on.
And then maybe over the first second, I'm going to add another keyframe.
Go back to the first keyframe.
I'm going to set that to zero press enter.
And there's absolutely nothing.
So now as we play through.
Okay.
Maybe a little bit fast.
Let's take that back and.
Yeah.
Maybe what I will do is offset the so he starts kind of fade in a little bit before we see it.
Good.
Now, the last thing we're going to do for this bet is we're going to select these two and we're going
to press F9.
We can right click and select.
Keyframe Assistant and easy ease, which as you can see, is F9.
Or you can just literally press F9 and that will give it now some kind of play with that.
Looks good doesn't that.
Now, the thing is, there's something that we've done that we don't actually need, and that is this
key framing of the opacity.
And why is that?
Well, because everything is being played about with the range selector and the blur.
We don't need to keyframe the opacity.
I'll prove it here.
If you see here, it kind of blurs in a little bit while we're kind of, you know, key framing and
the opacity from zero all the way to 100%.
Now, if I take this back to the beginning and get rid of these key frames, it stays at zero.
Watch this now.
And it actually does a better job.
And it's because of the coding within all of this with the range selector and the blur.
So don't need to worry about with the opacity.
The reason why we brought it in and we added it was so we could set it to zero because everything else
up happens above it.
So it kind of works in a chain.
It looks good.
That doesn't it?
I'm actually going to do that over a little bit of a longer time.
Maybe over.
Yeah, 2 seconds.
Yeah, I love it.
I love that effect.
So this is the basis of of what we want.
If I just zoom out a little and come back to the beginning and.
Yeah.
It's kind of what we want now.
What I actually want is I don't want this to be like, you know, stupid long, 20 seconds long.
What would it do is in a trim this down and we want this to be maybe if we look at it now and it fails
and fades in even kind of and we start fading out.
But there so we're talking, yes, 7 seconds and two frames.
So let's just see and delete that press.
Oh, boom.
I'm when I was 7 seconds.
What going to do is we're going to close this up just by doing this.
Right here.
And what that does is that changes the work area.
Okay.
Now, we could we could shorten everything by coming up to here composition, composition, settings
and typing in the duration of, you know, zero seven, zero zero and then pressing enter.
But this is the easy way.
We brought it down exactly where wants it.
We just right click here.
Oh.
So there were I just had the mouse over work area and you got the side by side if you right click anyway
here does my the way you play headers right click and trim come to work area boom we now we're just
in the work area.
In fact if you left your mouse, if you left you play hide off the end and then click to work area.
You'd have lost you play have.
I'm joking idiot.
It's okay we've got this in.
Oh that there.
And then we're going to start fading it out and I'm actually going to fade this in just a little bit
sooner.
Good because I like to fade out to be a little take a little bit longer on the way which you're going
to fade out is it's the offset that is creating this whole fade in of all the blurs.
So we're going to select these to kind of press control and see them right here where a play head is.
If we control and V, we paste those two again now they're going in the wrong order.
So all we do is just right click, go to Keyframe Assistant and we go to time reverse keyframes.
So now swap them about.
So as you can see, this keyframe is the same as this keyframe and we go out, okay, now just let me
just get this last keyframe and a point right the way it's the back.
So then we kind of we blur and hold it for a bit.
And then we blur out over a different amount of time.
Now, if we look, as we said before, think about the randomized order.
If we turned off randomized order for a second and we played that through, it would fade in like this
and then fade out like that.
Okay.
However, we don't control that.
I won't say randomizing in the minute that you turn to randomize or to arm.
It gives you the random seed.
We spoke about this at the beginning.
A more on zero and zero means if we scroll through slowly, we have.
Disappearing and then t appearing and then the T and then the n k and then everything else.
If we go and go backwards.
As you'll see, we have the last ones to appear or to remain on were the first ones to come on.
So we've got the date, the T, the T and the end.
Keep going.
Yeah.
And the easy way to, to what I want for this effect is to have a different order going out.
And the easiest way to do this is somewhere between these two key frames where nothing is happening.
We just set the stopwatch for random seat.
We then go forward one frame.
How do we go forward?
One frame on the keyboard.
It's not just right on your on your the arrow buttons.
It's either page down.
If you remembered that well done, or you hold down control and press left and right.
So we've got one frame, as you can see here, and then we're just going to change this to one.
So that's actually key frame in between the seed order in a place where you don't see anything happening.
So just to remind ourselves, we have the.
D in the T in the T in the end coming in first.
But because we've changed the seed order.
As we go.
The last letters are still the D for the H and the I.
And it's a different order going out.
Okay.
Good.
Happy with that?
I'm just going to control that.
Happy?
This is pretty much.
We're almost out out there now.
We're done for this building of it.
There's just one other thing I want to do, and that is I want to change.
I want to put some movement on this.
Now, an easy way to do this would be to come up here, close it all up, and press on a keyboard for
scale.
Go right to the beginning, keyframe it, go right to the end, or press o on your keyboard to go to
the end.
It's another shortcut for you and go to maybe 110.
Hit enter.
Go back to the beginning and we've got this moving over time.
And that kind of gives a good effect.
However, I'm going to undo and undo and leave the scale at 100, and what we're going to do is going
to play with the tracking.
Remember in here where we had a.
And primary composer.
And it was this.
And we played with the tracking.
I suppose the tracking right here we're looking at the we just had but for now we played with the with
tracking of here so it's actually the spacing in between the that the text and the letters that's it.
But it doesn't affect the size of the letters.
That's what we're going to do with here.
And the thing is in this one, that we just undo that you had to set the tracking, and that's kind
of all it was.
However, in here we can set what the tracking does and the way in which we do this is that we shutdown
the text and on the text layer, remember we added an animation.
So we have the blur.
We just literally add tracking to our whole composition.
And as you can see here, we've got our tracking right here.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to set the keyframe of zero, drag it right the way back.
I'm doing it here.
Oh, by the way, you can't just keep dragging in after effects.
You've got to place it.
You see, if I keep dragging now, it kind of goes off.
So just be aware of that.
And the reason why I'm doing it here is actually I'm going to bring my mouse here so I can see how much
it tracks.
And I'm just going to drag out just a little bit.
Only about maybe 20.
That's probably enough for me.
And then I'm going to drag that all the way to the end.
Again, not going all the way off the screen, just here and now if we play that back.
There's no movement, although at first it looks like it's it's zooming in.
But it's actually not.
It's just moving out.
Looks good, doesn't it?
And just to confirm that if I go to scale, look, there's absolutely no movement.
It stays at 100% all the way through.
But because of the D Blur and I'm looking at the teen, I just watched a teen.
It looks like it grows a little, but it's not.
It's just becoming clearer.
And that tracking will then go all the way over the end.
Now, let me just get those key frames up again by you on the keyboard.
This is a linear keyframe.
We're not using this because we kind of want this to be constant all the way through.
And that right there is your own graphic.
And the reason why it's important to do this all on this graphic is because now nothing changes.
Even if you change the text, if I come into here and double click it, which brings up this and I go,
Let's go wild and click out, find, bring that back to the beginning again.
This is now going to randomize all of those letters.
Exactly how we said before it's going to control back into the wild is better.
And if I just save that and I'm going to go back to Premiere Pro and obviously we shut down the workspace
now and again, this is again a reason why we we we duplicated it.
And I'm going to turn that back on.
And now let's play that.
And now we have the text.
Brilliant.
Now, if you're happy with that and you're done, then you're done.
But we're going to go further now and we're going to give you the ability to make this again and again
and again, or use this again and again and again without having to go through all that, because we're
now going to create this or make this converted into a motion graphics template.


### 31. Converting Text Animation to MOGRT (Motion Graphics Template)

So when we left off, we had created this lovely text effect.
It's brilliant.
I absolutely love it.
But what this is, it's an after effects round robin Diane dynamic linked project, and we can't do
anything with it if we select this and two essential graphics at it.
You can't do anything.
In this chapter, I'm going to show you how to change all that.
And this I promise you, this will really set you up for any graphics you want to make that you feel
you would remake.
If you've got clients that you want to kind of set a kind of whole graphics style and then just reuse
with projects or say you run a YouTube channel and you want to set these things up.
This is how you do it.
So let's go back to our After Effects project because this is our starting position and we're going
to open something in after effects that we've never opened before.
So go back to my selection tool.
I need to open a window.
You know what we've got here?
We've got info in audio and preview those three.
By the way, I've never opened in my life, nor have I ever opened libraries.
But what we need to open is window and essential graphics.
So if you haven't got it open, open it now.
And now we've got a new window.
What does this mean?
Okay, this is brilliant.
Honestly, this is brilliant.
So we need to select a composition that this is going to read from, which in this case is blur, text
effects linked.
So that's dropped down and it's the only composition here.
So boom, let's go.
Now we want to title this.
So this title will be searchable when we export it in here in essential graphics.
So let's call it something that it kind of resembles and I call it the blur text effect.
So let's just say blur text and I'm actually going to call this in and out hit enter.
The reason why I've called in and out is because, you know, it's animating in and animating out.
Good.
That makes sense.
Finally, before we go any further, we need to set a poster time.
And what this is, is, as you can see right now, we've got black.
And if we were in Premiere Pro and starting to search, you'd need to be able to see something.
All these have had a poster time set on them.
Remember what?
We downloaded this, we downloaded this guy, and we're playing this in the picture of a thing.
I know we've come a long way since then.
If you've watched every single chapter and you've learned something, feel proud.
Just.
Just take a moment and feel proud because you've made it this far.
So you must have you must have some learning in there now.
I hope I hope you've got out of this.
What you what you, what you wanted to.
Anyway, let's go back here and of the soppy stuff and we need to set our post to time.
So you find your play had somewhere, which kind of represents it.
I'm actually going to put it around here because it kind of gives me that effect as well.
So it kind of sells it to my head there.
AKA Yeah, it's the one that does that, not just that, which is just a bit just some random piece
text.
So I'm going to maybe do it to there.
So it kind of gives me a setting.
I'm just going to hit, set, post the time and that kind of you bring it in a little bit more fits
all on its own set post that.
Yeah.
Okay so that kind of tells me are you with that blurred text and that yeah, I know I'm doing okay.
So what do we do.
Well, what we now need to think about the kind of things that we would want to change in this if it
were a template.
And the first thing with it being text would be the text.
So let's start as we mean to go on and then do this once and then we'll go cherry picking and I'll show
you an easy way to do this.
But first and foremost, we're going to drop down this and all these actually already open.
But we have source text and that source text is what's in here.
And source text is definitely something we're going to want to change.
So what we do is we grab it, we drag it and we drop it, and now we have a source text it, labels
the value, what's actually here.
So we're going to change this and we're going to say text and then just click out.
I also want to be able to edit the properties.
If you were doing this for a client and you didn't want them to change anything, you didn't want to
change the size or the font or the font width or anything, you would just literally leave it as that.
However, we want to be able to edit the property.
So I'm going to enable custom font selection, going to enable font size adjustments, and then we're
going to enable faux styles.
Leave it as that.
That's how we want to press.
Okay.
And watch a page once we press.
Okay, boom, we now have the ability to change our text and styles look.
And but when we toggled this on enough watch.
Finished changed.
Come back also.
It's changed.
So this now is perfectly rigged up.
Where have we seen this before?
Yes, you're absolutely right.
We going to premiere composer.
Just go for essential typography, drag anything.
Anywhere.
Click here.
Look.
We have the same well, pretty much to say, and they've added other things, but we've got the same
swing now still.
We're now starting to build what we're doing.
And there are also some things that you're not going to want to put into this essential graphics panel
to change, such as things that we've keyframe, because that could really just open up a whole host
of problems.
However, because you've made it, once you then start testing it, you can then decide other things.
So yeah, we'll cover that as well.
So we've, we've whittled down and we found source text and we've put that in and we've allowed it to
edit the properties.
But what else can we put in here?
Well, rather than going down and thinking, Oh, would I want that dragging in and seeing if it would
allow you can actually so low supported properties by clicking that.
That will do.
In fact, let me just close that up so you can see it properly.
It's close to that.
And so those four properties, if I'm going to get rid of that piece of video because we don't need
that now, sell us for the properties, click that.
And now every single thing that you can see can be added to your essential graphics.
So what else do we think could be added into here?
Well, I'm thinking the colour.
So here's the fill in stroke.
So maybe drag that in.
Oh, okay.
That doesn't look right.
And no, it isn't because and this is a crazy thing in in after effects is that the fill isn't contained
in the text.
The fell or the colour of text, should I say, is not content contained in the text, it's in the character
bit over here and this is still linking to over here and we can't grab this and put it in here.
I know it's a bit of a pain.
So what we need to do is we actually need to add a fill to this layer.
I know it's a pain.
It's even more of a pain.
If you had to go up to effect some presets and search for it.
But we don't do any because with that selected we just hit control and spacebar and it brings up our
effects console.
If you haven't touched on that, don't forget you need to get this down.
It's free.
Link is in the course outline.
It's brilliant.
So we're just going to search for fill and we want to apply fill.
So click fill and now it's turned red.
Hmm.
Why is it done that?
Well, because we've added a fill right here in our effects controls for this bad boy.
If we get solo properties again and then solar properties again.
If we search for our fill, it's now down here.
Good.
I know it's frustrating.
However, if we grab this colour and drag it into here, we've got our fill colour, but it's red,
don't worry.
So we're going to put we're going to rename this as text colour and I'm actually going to use a U in
that because I'm English.
United Kingdom.
And then we can set this back to White.
What does that do?
Well, that does two things.
It first takes it back to what we wanted it to and also confirms that this is working in our essential
graphics panel.
Good.
Anything else?
Well, there's a number of things we can do.
How about the position of this text?
Definitely.
One are going to be able to affect that position or we can change the size.
But it doesn't change our position, does it?
No, no, no.
So let's find that we come back up here.
Okay.
What in the world that's all about?
Where does our transfer form happen?
It happens right at the bottom.
Grab opposition and drag that into here.
And we just change this and say, text position, press enter.
And now we know that we are all good.
We can change it from side to side, should we wish we may.
When we're actually in this and we using this in a project, we may think, Oh, I wonder, maybe this
will work well as a lower third.
Okay.
Or we could drag that down here.
Drag that down here.
Well, actually, it's a little bit too big for a lower third.
Ah, don't worry.
I've put the text size in here so we can do that and do that bearing in mind that it tracks out.
But having done that, take off those title actions safe and all of a sudden it turns into a lower third.
The whites only turning off there because we're pre rendering.
It's only going that far.
It's really handy when it does that.
But if we bring it up, it further cracking good.
So undo that and undo again because I don't want it there.
I want it back in the centre and.
Good.
Happy.
We're happy so far.
Good.
Let's carry on.
So we've got our text done.
We've got our font done.
How about.
Well, do we want to give an option for maybe a drop shadow?
Let's say, if this was on.
Well, actually, if we come back to the Premier Pro and look on here, let's get rid of that now.
Could this benefit from maybe a drop shadow?
Well, yeah, I guess it could.
And giving it the option could help.
So what do we do?
Well, first, we need to apply a drop shadow.
Let's go to toggle this just so we can see.
That's called new solid, actually.
Let's just go white talk about up and put that below.
Don't have to have this, but we can't see anything and that kind of helps us.
So I'm going to select this.
I'm going to control and spacebar and I'm going to search for drop shadow drop back on there.
Okay.
That's now starting to work.
However, we want this in here.
Hmm.
Can we?
Well, let's find out.
Let's select the text solo supported properties.
And do we have the drop shadow in here coming?
Yeah, we do.
Grab the drop shadow.
Drop it in.
And nothing happens.
That's because it's only these bits that we can affect.
So how do we get that in?
Okay, well, let's just grab the first thing here.
Drop shadow color.
Good.
We can do that.
Drop shadow color.
Drop.
Shadow.
Shadow cover.
Yeah.
Okay, that works.
I'm going to change that in a way, but just.
It offends me.
We're then going to change the opacity.
So I'm going to say drop shadow opacity.
Drop shadow direction.
Yeah.
Drop shadow distance and drop shadow softness.
I know that's a lot for the drop shadow, but it's the only way of getting all of these in here.
But that's fine for me.
And if I now press save that.
If I now get rid of this white solid, can't see the drop shadow now.
But if we go back to here, we now have the ability if we just close out this for now and maybe size
this up a little bit so we can see, do we have a drop?
Shadow?
Yeah, we kind of do.
We can't edit it.
Yeah, but it kind of works.
Maybe if we turn back on this white solid and effect it a little bit.
Let's see if all of these are working.
Okay.
Yeah, that seems to be working.
Maybe soften it up a little bit.
That seems to be working.
Opacity.
Take that all the way up.
That seems to be working.
Control and s and the beauty of doing it this way is the fact that it helps us.
Oh, yeah, we've got the white side on control and it helps us work out if it's actually going to work
in what we need.
And that yeah, it seems to be working absolutely fine.
In fact, with that drop shadow, it really kind of sets it off a little bit more.
Does that?
Yeah.
It just makes it stand out a little bit more.
Good.
Happy with that?
So let's.
I'm just going to undo, undo, undo, undo, undo and keep on doing until this goes.
Okay.
And control shift and z to redo the last thing.
Happy with that?
And yeah, that all works for me.
The opacity obviously will work really well as well because if you don't want to drop shadow on it,
even when you're using this in your projects in Premiere Pro, well, you just take the opacity to zero
and it will turn off, you know that.
However, if this is going out to somebody, what you could do is you could click in here and say 0%
for.
Off.
Yeah.
I did the capital for a number.
Does anyone else hold down shift when they press numbers?
If it's the beginning of something and think, oh yeah, I didn't want that.
So 0% for off.
So that's just giving a little bit of notes to whoever may be using this in the future or to remind
yourself.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I meant to think that.
Mm hmm.
So.
Yeah.
Helps control is just going to say that.
I know it's almost like a it's a natural reflex, isn't it, for me.
We could also at the anchor point, if we wanted to, into here.
I've never really felt the need to do it, but everything seems to be absolutely fine.
Would we want to?
Would we want to change the seat amount?
Because obviously we've changed the seat amounts in here so it goes out and a different thing.
Well, no, because this is already keyframe.
If we drag this into here now, it's key framed and the key frames will be ignored.
Press okay.
And do so.
We don't you can't really do that.
And there are ways to kind of get around it with sliders and stuff.
But I mean, that is like beyond beyond the needs that I've ever had.
But yeah, I'm happy with that.
So let's come back down here.
Let's turn off the white solid and good control safe.
And it should be in Premiere Pro, shouldn't should it?
No, it shouldn't because we're not there.
We need to get it into Premiere Pro.
And how do we do that?
Well, it's actually a lot simpler than you may think.
We just closed this up, so we're not being absolutely bombarded.
I'm going to get rid of that white solid because we don't need it.
So we've got text, we've got text, colour, text, position, drop, shadow.
If we need it, everything's good.
We're happy with that.
There's one thing I've got in mind that we may need to change, but it's not currently supported.
So I'll show you workaround until back is supported.
When you get this.
It might be supported, but we've been calling out for it in the community for a number of years, however
dodgy about that.
Right now we have our name set.
We set that right at the beginning, but if you haven't already, it'll be saying untitled.
You need to set that.
You just need to.
And it wouldn't bother you in the first time, but you'd be searching for Untitled in Premiere Pro.
And not only that, but when you set up another one, if you didn't rename it, it would overwrite the
first one.
So let's not get into that.
So okay, we are here.
Done, we're ready.
So we just save it.
If you don't save will prompt you to save this project and we export motion graphics template now pay
attention.
This is important because we want to be warned if the motion graphics template uses fonts that are not
available from Adobe Fonts, what does that mean?
Well, you seen in the past when we've gone into here, let's just open again the essential graphics,
tablet, tap even or window in premiere pro.
And you can see you see these two things here that tells me that we've got fonts that aren't currently
installed in this machine.
However, we if we grab this down, it doesn't automatically bring in the funds.
Well, it will tell me, Oh yeah, we don't support this.
We'd have to go and find that font somewhere else.
It's no biggie.
But it's good to know and it's good to be told, especially if you're sending this motion graphics template
to somebody else.
Also warn me if after effects needs to be installed in order to customize this motion graphics template.
Remember right at the beginning, when we start playing with stuff and I said you need after effects
install to be able to run this, you don't necessarily have to have opened it, but you do need it installed.
That's literally just a heads up so you don't get something into Premiere Pro.
If you haven't got the after effects installed, you will have because obviously you got this far in
the in the course.
But again, if you're sending this motion graphics template to somebody else or you're just take it
onto another computer just to run.
If you haven't got after effects installed and it needs after effects installed, you'll get a pop up.
Just saying guys, you need after effects crack in.
It just helps and warn me the last one warn me if there are text controls that cannot be edited with
the premiere pro type tool, that's fine.
The premiere pro type tools don't why they haven't changed that, but the premiere pro type tool is
what it used to be called.
It's now called Essential Graphics, which comes in line with Essential Graphics.
We just want that.
That's all we need all done.
Keywords.
We can add some keywords just in case.
Maybe you don't remember the words.
We don't remember the title.
Even blurred text in and out.
She could put blurring.
And when I first thought of that scene, I thought of wilderness.
This is purely for your own memory, really.
I would say, I don't know, landscape, that kind of thing.
If you search for those things.
Also in essential graphics, these will come up as well.
It just kind of helps really.
And you could say in and out that does crack in.
You get the picture press, okay.
And now it starts to verify.
And the following one fonts were not sent from Adobe Next Light.
So that's one of the first, although you could get a warning from what it says here in Premiere Pro.
This is giving us the warning heads up, by the way.
The font that you're using right here could not be sent from Adobe.
That's fine.
Next flight is one that I've downloaded.
I love the next family, and it's the next family of fonts, by the way.
There's not a family that I know that whose surname is Nexa.
But yeah, I love the I love the Nexa font family.
So this is the one that we are using, but that's cool.
It just gives you the heads up.
By the way, if you use this on another machine again that doesn't have next flight installed, Adobe
is not going to be able to activate that font for you.
You'll have to go and find it yourself.
But remember, we also have the ability to change the fonts.
So if whoever's using this does not have Nexus, it doesn't have time to get Nexa down or it doesn't
have an internet connection or whatever.
They can change it to whatever font they want.
Good.
That's why it's important to allow that the font and the style to be changed.
Press Okay.
And that's dumb.
I'm not even going to restart anything.
I just know it's called blurred text and I'm going to go over to here.
I'm going to delete that after effects template and let's just search blur press enter and there is
our motion graphics template.
If I press I on here, this also gives us any information.
It shows us that the duration is 7 seconds.
The file size cracking doesn't matter.
Font's next select and the keywords.
And you can add more keywords here if you wanted to.
It would only.
In fact, it would only.
In fact, it would only affect the actual installation in this version of Premiere Pro.
It wouldn't affect the original, but it would help you.
So say landscape.
We put landscape in before, didn't we?
So if we come in here and we type landscape and press enter, we have all we used this before it.
But when we use this, why would that be landscape?
Because it's landscape rather than portrait.
And we have now our motion graphics template.
So let's test it and see if it works.
So we grab it right out of the essential graphics and we drop it where we want it done.
And now we selected it and look what we've got, everything that we added in.
So we've got our text that we can change.
Come with me.
Doesn't update here.
Click out.
It does update.
By the way, if you really want everything to update as you're typing, remember we put in premiere
composer before.
Well, the thing is, your motion graphics template can also work in premiere composer.
Look, I've got essential graphics here and this is all this, but premiere composer is here and the
beauty premiere composer that I absolutely love is if you type now
watch.
See, it's actually only pointed at the screen, then you can't see my finger.
It actually starts to put it up here.
So that's go away.
Boom, done.
And I do want that that drop shadow and obviously this is great now because we've got this here we can
add that drop shadow is going to come back to essential graphics just in case you haven't installed
premiere composer.
And if you haven't, why not?
Seriously, the vast majority of the stuff that I've used in this whole course has been from premiere
composer.
And so the vast majority of the stuff that I've used from premiere composer in this course is completely
100% free.
So if you haven't got it right by if you haven't got it by now, just do it.
Go and get it.
And 100% opacity to change that distance we can actually effects.
It's taken a while to catch up, but we can affect the distance of our drop shadow set boom.
Let's take it a little bit there maybe at the self and say you get it in here and you think, oh, I
don't really like it now, I don't really like the font or I changed the font.
Part of what you want to know is that I've just selected notes that I just couldn't help myself.
Honestly, I just couldn't help myself.
Why is it on to MUZIO or is MUZIO that.
Oh, that's quite a nice font, isn't it?
That's lovely.
But it's not the one I selected.
I went for no ESTA and I want no esta.
There we go.
Let's go away.
If you want to change things.
What we want to change the size.
We could drag that up a little bit.
Okay, I've just put your end to this because I want to kind of I want to I want to make this point
because I think it's really important, although I would like to make this point first.
No ESTA works really well, but this with this scene, I think no ESTA works with everything.
However, let's start to kind of finesse what we're doing because first off, I don't think that we
really want the actual number of the text because obviously we're 363 now and a slider is almost all
the way up.
If we wanted to go much higher, we'd probably have to click in and start typing and that kind of it's
not really what I want.
Also text position, it's a bit random, you know, it's, it's not, it's not kind of the numbers that
we want.
It's not 2048 by 1080, which is obviously 4K.
If this was 1080 would be 960, 540.
And it's just it just doesn't look clean for me and for me.
If we're going to all the I don't know the trouble to do this.
I think it's important to do it right.
And if you do it right the first time, it then saves any problems going forward.
So let's go back to our after effects and let's tweak this.
And that's the beauty of making this yourself because you can go back to After Effects and.
What I want to do first.
Well, I don't want this because this is just annoying the size and all that.
So first I'm going to get rid of this.
So I'm going to edit properties and I'm going to get rid of enable font size adjustment.
Boom.
Done.
We've got rid of that slider.
Also text position.
It doesn't really look quite right.
It just doesn't feel nice to me.
So we're going to change that as well.
So we're going to grab that and we're going to right click.
No, we're not.
We're going to select it and we're just going to press delete and that removes it from the list, bearing
in mind that we want to kind of get whatever we're going to bring back in if we're going to bring it
in here.
But let's, let's, let's do that.
So what we want to do is we want to control this, but not within its own controls.
Does that make sense?
We put it in the source text and we said, Yeah, okay, we want to size up the size and we included
that.
But it didn't look right.
Also, we dragged in the position from here, from pee, and that just didn't feel right because it
said 2047 and over.
And the thing is, maybe this isn't actually right if I reset, but it's brought it up a little bit.
But let's say actually that the default position is here and that's where you want it to be.
Well, you don't want to be reading all this.
So this is where what we're going to add now will just make it cleaner.
Let me undo that and undo it again.
Let's just take it back to where it was, which was 27.4 by 11 06.4 crack and let's create a null.
Member.
What a notice.
A nail does nothing unless you put something to it.
Remember, we created those before when we've been doing tracking and no can control or be sent information
to.
Well, that's what we're going to do here.
We're going to going to control.
So we're going to go new.
Sorry.
Any empty space here?
Right click new and no.
Where is it?
They are no object.
And as always, by default, the anchor point is in the top left and the anchor point is the center
of the composition.
I just like a node to be clean.
So we set the anchor point here.
Don't forget, you can control and double click here, but if you have the anchor point, move to another
thing that comes completely free with animation composer, which is all together the after effects version
of Mr. Horse Premiere Composer.
So we're going to click that and get it right to the center.
Then we kind of come to a line and press center making sure that composition is dropped down, not selection.
We're going to press center and middle or line vertically and horizontally cracking done.
Happy with that?
Is this Daphne in the center?
Yes, it is.
Is that in the center?
Cool.
So we're now all crackin and ready.
Now what do we do?
Have a think.
What are we going to do with the null?
Exactly.
I hope you said we're going to parent the no.
To the into the wild.
Or did you say Pickwick?
Pickwick.
It's always good.
You can have the drop this down and say no or we can grab this little pick whip both under parent and
link and select the null and let go.
So now I know is controlling our tax layer.
And now if we drop this down and transform, we now have more position, scale and all those options.
And not only that, we have 100% and our position is clean for me.
So let's grab the position and drag that up here above the drop shadow, but below below the text color.
Boom.
No position one.
We're going to change this to tax position.
I'm press enter.
We're then going to grab the scale and put that above the position.
And we're going to put we're going to lie and say font size.
Press Enter.
So now this is 100% and we can go bigger than 100% or smaller than 100%, but 100% is right in the center.
So we're not having to worry with all this anymore.
This hasn't changed yet because we haven't overwritten it.
Bear with me.
Let's come back to here.
Let's just check our font size has changed.
That's absolutely fine.
Has our text position that works now as well happy with that?
So now what do we do?
Because we've changed an already exported motion graphics template?
Well, all we need to do is overwrite what we've already exported.
And to do that and I'm not going to save this, so I'll show you what happens.
You go to Export Motion Graphics template, it will tell you that the project needs to be saved first.
Do you want to save it?
Stupid question in my my mind.
Just automatically save it and start it.
But yes, let's save it.
I guess it stops you overwriting.
It kind of gives you a little.
Oh, hold on.
Did you really want to operate it?
So we've got all this boom, boom, boom, something.
The key was kept from the last time.
I'm not going to put them in again, but they weren't kept.
It's a shame.
But you just put your keywords in there again because you may have made a new version of this.
You say, say this was a different one.
And of course, you just change the name, export it out, and that way it wouldn't overwrites it would
be an additional.
And so yeah, that's I guess that's why it's asking you do you want to save?
So we're going to get all the compatibility warnings going.
We find that when we press okay, it's going to say the file already exists.
Do you want to replace it?
Because there's already is picked up.
There's a file saying blur, text in and out.
Well, yes, we do want to replace it.
And again, it's telling us that next light is not on Adobe fault.
That's absolutely fine.
Font, font press.
Okay, nothing happens.
However, in the background, everything happens.
So we come back in here, we click it and nothing's changed.
Well, that's because this is the old version.
However, we can't search for the old version now because the old version has changed.
I'll prove it to you.
Come back to browse.
Let's search for Blur again and drag this into the side.
And if we go here now, we're now back to that original font and we have our font size in this order
and text position like this.
But if we click this other one, it's still got the old version.
Now let's just say, for argument's sake, that this, this whole thing create contains something that
has changed fundamentally, like maybe a color or a text, a text font.
And you need to change them all.
You need to change everything and you've got like maybe six or seven in one project.
Well, we can do that.
Let's just duplicate that for now.
This is the new one.
These are the old ones.
And we want to replace these old ones with the new one.
Hmm.
How do we do that?
Well, it's really quite simple.
Let me just delete that for now.
And just to highlight, just to show you, it is the old version.
Obviously, we've got the text going up here.
We go to this one that we've duplicated.
And again, we've got the text sizing up here and it's just not right.
Well, let's come back to browse, search for Blur.
And there's our Blur text in and out.
And what we're going to do is we're going to drag this holding down the alt key.
I'm going to drag it on top of here, alt onto another one, overwrites.
We're going to let that go and it's going to come up with this.
Do you want to replace all of our instances of this graphic in all sequences with the new template?
So this is saying every single other instance that you have with this, because this has been overwritten,
what do you want to do?
Do you want to keep those all those others as they were, or do you want to update them with this new
version?
Well, the for instance that I gave you was, yes, we need to replace them all because the client wasn't
happy and wanted to change it.
So we just said yes.
And now this version has everything we needed.
Although and I don't know if this is a glitch in the system, it still has the ability to change the
font size here, and I think that's because it already had it in.
If we bring this in here and drag this in.
Brand new version doesn't have the slider.
This version does have the slider.
However, this version, as well as having the slider to change the font size, also has this to change
the font size so we could make it huge with this size all the way up and then bring it back down.
With this slider, it kind of contradicts a little bit, but yeah, you know what I'm saying?
But it gets everything to the point that you need it to.
Most importantly, though, let me just undo that.
What didn't change?
Well, this is a brand new version, and this has Naxalite.
However, I dragged in over this one.
And while it changed everything.
Yeah, it kept the font size there.
What it did do is it obey the fact that in this version, in this instance of this motion graphics template,
I had changed the font.
Not only had I changed the font, I'd also changed the text.
Because if you remember, what we're being outputting is into the wild.
But I changed this text to Let's Go Away.
So it had added the new stuff, as it were, but it had kept the fact that I wanted drop shadow at 100%
and it kept the distance and the softness and the text change and also the font.
And that's why it's a motion graphics template that we will create initially and then add it from as
we go.
This levels of everything does motion graphics templates and helps you have consistency across videos
when they're all maybe the same kind of a series or as I said before, the same the same channel on
YouTube or Instagram accounts or anything like that.
But essentially what we've done is we've created this.
If I just press over there and pre render, we've created this motion graphics template which we can
change up the text, the size, the color, even.
And we can create literally anything that we want from this one thing.
If we just change that out now and go here and say, change this to the great beyond.
And this is still actually capitals.
It doesn't really matter.
So we'll just let that kind of catch up.
I would love my system to catch up.
I dare you.
I double dare you.
I'm going to change the text color to maybe a blue.
I'm going to leave now.
Oh, you're back in the room now.
Going to leave the opacity.
The opacity?
100% for a far drop shadow.
I'm actually going to change that to maybe a little bit of a lighter blue, maybe like Face the Great
Beyond.
And all of a sudden we're just a few clicks just duplicating this and continuing to edit it.
Within Premiere Pro, we've got two instances of it.
Now, if I put these back to back.
I'm.
Play them.
Oh, brilliant.
Of course, it was of a different video footage showing need to prevent it.
But the most important thing to remember is that if we duplicated this and if it was still the original
after effects dynamic link project in and out, if we then duplicated it and changed it, both instances
will be changed because you're duplicating the thing that we're actually changing in after effects.
However, because we've exported the motion graphics template and brought it in to here, not only can
we create one version, one instance of this motion graphics template, but we can create as many different
instances as we want.
And that has got to be worth the time taken to create it in the first place, because now I have this
to use wherever I want, for whatever I want.
Not only that, but I can send this to somebody else.
So another editor who's working on the same series or for the same client, and they've got everything
set up.
So you don't have to be saints, though.
Oh, by the way, the font size, there's the text.
Is this the duration?
Is this the effect that you need to use to bring it on his face and the fact you need to bring it out
is this you just send them this mock at this motion graphics template.
They install it onto their machine.
Everything is the same.
