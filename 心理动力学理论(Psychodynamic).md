心理动力学理论(Psychodynamic )，也被称为精神分析(psychoanalytic )理论，是由 [[Sigmund Freud]] 开发的一种理论方法。
```
它侧重于人们的无意识思维(unconscious minds)和早期生活经历如何塑造他们成年后的行为和决定。心理动力学认为人格(personality)或行为(behavior)是个人的本能需求和冲动与社会或外部力量的要求之间内在冲突的结果。换句话说，它通过分析个人的内部动力，如冲突的思想、信仰、情绪、动机和可能影响当前行为的过去经验，研究个人如何应对外部压力。其目的是帮助个人更好地了解自己，以便他们能够为自己做出更好的决定。

-   Psychodynamic theory, also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, helps clients understand their emotions and unconscious patterns of behavior by talking through these emotions and behaviors with a social worker.
-   Forces outside of a person’s awareness explain why they behave a certain way.
-   Today psychodynamic theory is not a unified theory. Instead, there are many related theories regarding human development and personality.
-   Many modern types of therapy emphasize mitigating or getting rid of the symptoms of a problem, while psychodynamic theory explores a person’s deeply rooted drives, needs and desires.
-   The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) was published in 2006 as an alternative or additional guide for clinicians to diagnose and treat clients.
    
-   The evolution of psychodynamic theory can be understood through four schools of thought:
    -   Drive theory:
        -   [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] believed a person’s behavior was the result of several drives including the sex (eros), self-preservation and destruction/aggression (death) drives.
        -   Id is the primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains the foundation of these drives.
        -   Superego is responsible for the morals of society as taught by a person’s parents, operating as a moral conscience.
        -   Ego mediates between the id and the external world—it is responsible for decision-making.
    -   Ego psychology:
        -   Theories on how a person’s ego functions have evolved since Freud.
        -   Some theorists believed the ego developed autonomously—free of intrapsychic conflict.
        -   They believed people had another drive to explore and control the world around them.
        -   According to ego psychology, a person’s environment and reality were also important to their development.
    -   Object relations theory:
        -   People were shaped by their relationships with significant others around them, like their parents and siblings.
        -   Under this theory, a person’s struggles have to do with their focus on maintaining relationships with others while also differentiating themselves.
        -   As adults, people repeat object relationships they formed in childhood.
    -   Self psychology:
        -   A person’s perception of themself is in relation to their boundaries or differences (or lack thereof) from others.
        -   This theory emphasizes the importance of a person’s sense of self in their development and behavior.

```Psychodynamic theory was originally a theory of personality created by FreudExternal link:open_in_new. It has evolved significantly over the years, and many theorists have contributed to it. Freud believed human behavior could be explained by intrapsychic processes and interpersonal patterns outside of a person’s conscious awareness and based on their childhood experiences. A general definition of psychodynamic theory is that forces outside of a person’s awareness explain why they behave a certain way.```
