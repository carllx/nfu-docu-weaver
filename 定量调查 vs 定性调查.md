(-- `Quantitative vs Qualitative User Research: Key Differences and Similarities - Aurelius` [aureliuslab](https://blog.aureliuslab.com/2021/10/13/quantitative-vs-qualitative-user-research/))

Here is a shortened version of the text in English, about half the original length:

Quantitative surveys collect structured data from a representative sample using closed-ended questions. The responses are numerically quantified and statistically analyzed. In contrast, qualitative surveys use open-ended questions to gather subjective descriptions from participants, aiming to understand their true thoughts and feelings by categorizing the textual or audio responses.


定量调查(Quantitative surveys)是通过对有代表性的样本进行结构化问卷调查,收集数据并进行统计分析和报告撰写的过程。它使用预设的封闭式问题(closed-ended questions),通过数字或统计方式量化答案信息。

[[Quantitative research]]与 [[Qualitative research]]相对,后者注重通过开放式问题(open-ended questions)获取被调查者的主观描述,理解其真实想法。
