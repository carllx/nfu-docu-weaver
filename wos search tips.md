(-- `Search tips - Web of Science - Guides and databases at University College London, Global` [ucl](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/web-of-science/search-tips))


Based on the search tips you've provided from Web of Science (WoS) and your interest in searching for learning or educational systems or platforms with a focus on web analytics, here's how you might structure your search queries to maximize the effectiveness of your research. Remember, these tips are for crafting a search strategy specifically for the WoS platform, but they also offer a general guide that can be adapted to other academic search engines and databases.

### Keyword Variations with Wildcards

1. **For learning or educational:**
    
    - Use `learn*` to find learning, learns, learners, etc.
    - Use `educat*` to find education, educational, educate, etc.
2. **For system or platform:**
    
    - `system*` could be used to find system, systems, systematic, etc.
    - `platform*` to find platform, platforms, etc.

### Variations and Spellings

If you are looking for specific terms that may have different spellings, use the asterisk in the middle of the word (if applicable):

- `behavio*r` to find behavior or behaviour in relation to learning behaviors.

### Phrase Searching

When looking for a specific concept or tool, you might know the exact phrase. For example:

- `"adaptive learning system"` will only find documents where this exact phrase appears.
- `"e-learning platform"`is another example where phrase searching might be beneficial.

### Proximity Searching

To find documents where two concepts are discussed in close proximity but not necessarily together, use the NEAR operator:

- `learning NEAR/5 analytics` to find documents where learning and analytics are mentioned within five words of each other.
- `educational NEAR/10 "web analytics"` to find connections between educational content and web analytics specifically.

### Example Search Queries

Considering the above strategies, here are a few example search queries you might construct:

1. **General search for learning systems with a focus on web analytics:**
    
    - `learn* NEAR/5 "web analytics" AND system*`
2. **Educational platforms specifically related to web analytics:**
    
    - `"e-learning platform*" AND "web analytics"`
3. **Broad search to capture both learning and educational platforms or systems:**
    
    - `(learn* OR educat*) AND (system* OR platform*) AND "web analytics"`

Remember, the effectiveness of your search will depend on combining these strategies thoughtfully based on your specific research needs. Experiment with different combinations and operators to find the most relevant results.
