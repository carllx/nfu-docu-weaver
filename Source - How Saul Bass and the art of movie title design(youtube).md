Transcript:
(00:03) first there was darkness and over darkness came white typography film titles used to look like this simple white typography over black if you take a look at most movies today the titles don't look much different light fonts over a dark background remained the ruling aesthetic but for a couple of periods the world of film design was a fertile ground for aesthetic and thematic innovations and it all started with one title in 1954 the go to website for all things title design describes carmen jones title sequence says
(00:51) quote a combination of two simple symbolic elements an illustration of a rose and a perpetual fire superimposed over one another for the duration of the sequence these elements summarize the emotional core of the film in which love lust greed betrayal and rage are not only key motivators but are often ambiguous and indistinguishable from one another the idea for this title sequence was to actually create a climate for the story that was about to unfold that's all best the man behind that sequence described by some as the
(01:24) putative father of all of today's credit designers others have said that he invented the modern movie title as we know it if you ask the designer himself he certainly wouldn't disabuse you of the notion you have to remember that until then titles have tended to be lists of dull credits mostly ignored or used for popcorn time but that's not exactly accurate here's a quick history lesson if we go back a bit further there's plenty of title sequences that do more than simply presenting a legal document to the audience
(01:55) which on paper is basically what title sequence is the introduction of the film and the list of the cast and crew usually by order of importance but contrary to what saw pass was saying as early as the 1930s you could already find great inventiveness in titles with stylish introductions like the one in 1939's the women the film carries vignettes of the all-female cast including images of animals that emotionally represent the characters like john crawford as a leopard and joan fontaine as a lamp at that time american cinema was rich in
(02:26) fourth wall breaking title sequences which means that the titles show up in the world of the film like 1934 the cat and the fiddle in 1941's you'll never get rich it's safe to assume that one of those titles inspired bass's end sequence of west side story a film that came along 20 years later and that's the end of our history lesson this is all to say there's more to title design than saw bass yet you can't argue that saubas didn't shift the paradigm in his early work in the 1950s and 60s
(02:56) because he did bass's approach was akin to a shorthand storyteller with most of his titles having a beginning a middle and an end he will often end the sequence with a little joke that's young christopher horak author of saw bass's anatomy of film design in spartacus you have the roman head that then cracks and falls apart indicating the fall of the roman empire so he he he did this over and over again to kind of end sequences that's all for structure now let's look at the titles aesthetically
(03:34) the most striking aspect of the sequences is that they look just like posters and that's because much of his film work was transversal to print conceived as one piece of the branding of the film bass's form of strategy was to deconstruct the film to find a graphic symbol that would represent its narrative theme the symbol that is the arm in its jagged form expressed the jarring disjointed existence of the drug addict he created the wealth of symbols that summarized the entire film like the broken body in saint joan the
(04:06) corpse from anatomy of a murder vertical spiral forms or the tears of ponchotistes the illustration of those symbols was inspired by the bauhaus movement a german school of design from the 1920s that gave us this chair this painting and this building bess's titles brought to the movies bauhaus formal principles of clean uncluttered design so clean that it would do away with serifed phones in his book harak reveals that in 53 credit sequences 37 used sunset reforms and none of them was papyrus here legibility is king basic geometric
(04:43) shapes a limited color palette either mostly primary colors or pastels and as we've seen local-like icons for product identity that in a nutshell is all bess's brand and that's not just an expression possibly the most important aspect of bass's early work is that his title designs were first and foremost a brand for example the iconic opening sequence of 1963's it's a mad mad mad mad world shares a near identical color scheme the same globe and the same character design with his ads for detroit news
(05:17) that bass made two years earlier whether in print or in film his style was imminently recognizable which ultimately led to his downfall okay maybe that's a bit too dramatic but bass did basically take a 20 year leave from designing title sequences it's unclear why but one theory is that bass was simply getting too successful for his own good with numerous critics saying that his titles were better than the actual films one said of the title sequence in 1962 as a walk on the wild side quote suggesting the story's themes of
(05:49) harlotry perversion and vengeance it set the mood that the ensuing picture tried but failed to match another theory was that title design was simply not profitable enough to justify the effort too labor intensive and just didn't make enough money even today big design studios like elastic largely use title sequences as call-in cards to build a portfolio that will appeal to brands that are usually better pink lines whatever the answer the fact is bass did stop making title sequences between seconds and 1987's broadcast news and
(06:23) over that period title sequences became something completely different with a group of vibrant new voices taking up the mantle and just flipping it on its head this video was created in partnership with 99 designs by vistaprint check out their 99 days of design at 99designs.com 99 days of design
