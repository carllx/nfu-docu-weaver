AI hallucination can be used to generate creative content such as art, music, and poetry[1]. It can also improve the performance of AI models in tasks such as object recognition and natural language processing[1]. However, there are also concerns about the negative effects of AI hallucination, such as blunting the success of chatbots[2], and ethical questions about the use of AI hallucination[3]. Some experts argue that AI doesn't actually hallucinate, but rather "makes things up"[4].
