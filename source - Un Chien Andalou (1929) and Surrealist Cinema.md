Transcript:
(00:00) hey folks and Welcome to our second video on  surrealist Cinema in this video we're going to   be spending a lot more time with a particular  film perhaps the most famous surrealist film   ocean andalou in the last video we looked at  some historical conditions of surrealism that   emerged in the 1920s as well as some major  aesthetic characteristics of surrealism and   we ended by looking at some of the reasons why  the surrealists were drawn to cinema as a medium   but we didn't quite look closely  at actual surrealist films
(00:34) so we're going to do that today we're going to  look closely at this film called ashian andalu   in English and Andalusian Dog by Luis bunuel  and Salvador Dali we talked about surrealist   artist Salvador Dali in the last video Luis  boonewell however is a Spanish filmmaker and   perhaps he's the best known filmmaker associated  with surrealism keep in mind that while this film   is generally attributed to both artists Dolly and  bunuel in film history we generally give a little   bit more heft to Luis bunuel as the author of this  film though it is of course still a collaboration
(01:07) so I think the first thing we might note  about the film is that the screenplay was   based on two dreams of its creators when well  and Dolly remember how we talked about in the   last video how surrealism can be understood as  a way of approaching art as much as a set of   characteristics we might identify in a particular  work of art and incorporating elements of one's   dreams was something that a lot of surrealist  artists did so bunuel and Dali got together   and they each had these images that they found  from their own dreams in which they wanted to
(01:37) incorporate into the film but well said he had  a dream of a cloud slicing the moon like quote   a razor blade slicing through an eye and Ali  said he had a dream of a hand crawling with ants   keep in mind of course that ants were a common  Motif in a lot of Dolly's paintings and we can   see them in the famous painting that he would make  a couple years later a Persistence of memory so   I think it's pretty important to note that this  film did not emerge from a concrete storyline but   rather from strange images the second thing that I  think is really important to understand about this
(02:13) film is that it is relatively plotless but it is  anti-narrative rather than non-narrative so first   I just want to acknowledge the relationship  between surrealist artists and conventional   narrative especially the conventional narratives  of films Andre Breton has this wonderful anecdote   where he talks about his own practices of watching  movies this is what he says he says I used to drop   into the cinema when whatever was playing was  playing at any point in the show and leaving out   the first hint of boredom to rush off to another  Cinema where we behave the same way I have never
(02:45) known anything so magnetizing so Andre Berton  being the author of The surrealist Manifesto has   this practice where he likes to go to the movies  but he doesn't like to stay for the entire film in   other words he likes to impose his own interest  onto a film and deny the film's demand that it   be understood as a complete story he seems to  be attracted to images and he seems to also   like to create his own juxtapositions between  one image and another by literally leaving the   theater portraying one film and enter another  exhibiting a different film that I think gives
(03:16) you a little hint at the relationship between  surrealism and conventional cinematic narrative   but now I want to be more precise about what I  mean about the difference between anti-narrative   and non-narrative David bordwell and Kristen  Thompson talk about this in their gloss on   surrealist film they say Hollywood filmmakers the  expressionists and the Impressionists were all   committed to storytelling even if their methods  differed but surrealist Cinema was anti-narrative   attacking causality and coherence so let's try to  figure out what bordwell and Thompson are saying
(03:48) here by expressionism and impressionism they're  referring to two contemporaneous avant-garde   film movements happening at the same time in the  1920s they're talking about these film movements   in Europe that push against the conventions of  Hollywood cinematic storytelling but the point   that bordwell is making is that even though the  French impressionist filmmakers and the German   expressionist filmmakers or pushing boundaries  they were still telling stories the Impressionists   would push boundaries in terms of camera effects  which they would use to render this objective
(04:20) experience of their characters the German  expressionists would push boundaries of mizon sen   which they would also use to render this objective  experience of characters right so we might say   that on the other side of avant-garde film which  Boardwalk doesn't talk about we have filmmakers   who avoid narrative altogether we have another  film movement in France in the 19 teens and 20s   sometimes called Cinema poor or pure Cinema we  have a similar movement in Germany in the teens   and 20s called absolute film and we have dada's  film associated with the Dada movement all of
(04:53) which are not giving us narratives at all that are  giving us a series of abstract images or rather   a series of images that relate to each other not  by means of cause and effect in a narrative chain   somewhere in the middle we have surrealist Cinema  surrealist Cinema is not as non-narrative as pure   Cinema or absolute Cinema but it's certainly not  as narrative as impressionist and expressionist   Cinema and figuring out the relationship between  surrealist Cinema and narrative I think is really
(05:22) important to understanding what surrealist Cinema  is and one reason this is really important is   because Luis bunuel was not only trying to make  a film that was pushing against Hollywood he   was equally interested in making a film that was  pushing against the other avant-garde filmmakers   at the time he looked at these abstract films and  he said I hate this stuff he didn't actually say I   hate this stuff this is what he said he said on  De Lu is a violent reaction against avant-garde   Cinema which was directed exclusively to  the artistic sensibility and the reason of
(05:56) The Spectator with its play of light and Shadow  its photographic effects its preoccupation with   rhythmic Montage in other words while bunwell  was certainly against Hollywood film the major   conventions of Storytelling established in the  United States He also thought that the options   for going against Hollywood Norms were a bit too  respectable they still presumed a certain value   in the quote-unquote artistic they were fancy  elevated they kind of shied away from the dark   and visceral aspects of the human unconscious in  a sense they sort of hid behind their photographic
(06:30) effects their plays of light and Shadow not  giving us a raw picture of the sometimes violent   and sexual motives that dwells in the unconscious  mind so once again let's get back to that idea of   surrealist Cinema being not non-narrative and not  a subjective narration that kind of goes into the   mind of a character but then comes back out but  rather anti-narrative so to be anti-narrative you   first need to give us something that looks like  scenes and characters and the film ocean andalu   does do that indeed the film gives us a kind of  prologue that seems to occur outside time but then
(07:04) we get a somewhat stable set of characters and  places we start with a man on a bicycle we get   intercuts with a woman in her apartment we quickly  see that the woman can see the man from her window   in the apartment the man falls on his bicycle and  she comes down to care for him and then soon after   he finds herself in her apartment we do have  something that resembles characters and we do   have something that resembles scenes which was not  seen in a lot of the non-narrative films of Cinema
(07:33) pure and absolute film and you might even say  that when you look at the film overall there's a   kind of General conflict and a general resolution  one of the major actions of the film if not the   major action of the film is that the man sexually  molests the woman he assaults her and she retreats   near the end of the film she escapes from him  exits her apartment finds herself on a beach   finds a new man and they Embrace and kiss so only  when we compare this film to actual non-narrative   films do we see the relationship between this film  and conventional narrative it's this relationship
(08:05) that grants the film something that we might  call anti-narrative rather than non-narrative   now let me show you what that looks like  so a simple example is something like the   film's deliberately disjointed chronology there  are many ways in which the film has a parotic   or ridiculing relationship to the conventions of  Storytelling especially cinematic storytelling you   can see that pretty clearly in its use of these  intertidals that give us chronological markers   eight years later around three in the morning 16  years before in the spring these kinds of titles
(08:37) are usually used in Hollywood film or narrative  film to show a clear causal relationship between   something that came before and something that came  after but in this film it's almost impossible to   see any concrete causal relationship between the  things that happened before the titles and the   things that happened after we get the same sort  of ridiculing effect with this first title that   says Once Upon a Time which we might associate  with the narrative Simplicity of a fairy tale   but more generally something that tells us  okay we are entering a story so what are the
(09:05) ways in which this film attacks narrative or  makes itself anti-narrative I think a key word   here is causality where will Thompson say but  surreala Cinema was anti-narrative attacking   causality and coherence so we can see that attack  on causality in a few different ways the opening   sequence is a kind of prologue where we start  with this male figure who's actually played by   Luis Manuel who has a Barber's blade in his hands  and he's sharpening it he steps outside onto his   balcony he looks up we cut to a shot of the Moon  and then suddenly we cut to a shot of a close-up
(09:38) of a woman's face with a man's hand holding her  eye open this is probably the most famous shot   from the entire film but I think it's important  to note something banal but true about this we   we got a wide shot of his balcony which you can  see here but there was no woman there the woman   suddenly appears out of thin air out of nowhere  not only that we also can't really be sure if it's   the barber who was grasping This Woman's eye  after all in the wide shot he doesn't have a   necktie and the close-up he does in the subsequent  shots we go from the man or a man with his blade
(10:09) about to draw it across the woman's eye then we  cut to the Moon a sort of graphic match where the   cloud slices across the moon and then we cut to a  blade actually slicing across an eye in this case   it's actually a close-up of a dead animal's  eye but it's supposed to be continuous with   the woman's face so you can see here that this  opening prologue thwarts a causal relationship   between events a woman suddenly appears I don't  know why this man is cutting her eye those causal   relationships between events which we look for in  narrative film are absent instead what seems to
(10:41) matter is a kind of juxtaposition or association  between these two different images images that are   violent and images that might be symbolic slicing  an eye and a cloud slicing a moon we get a similar   absence of causation when immediately after we  get that sliced eye shot we get an intertidal sank   eight years later and then we see the same woman  or at least the same actress we get a look at our   eyeballs and she's completely fine it's confirmed  in some way that these chronological markers are
(11:09) meaningless or if they are meaningful they're not  giving us the kind of causal narrative meaning   that they usually do in conventional films so what  we have here in this privileging of unexpected   juxtapositions is once again a testament to a  aesthetic characteristic of surrealism that often   reveled in unexpected juxtapositions of course  we also have elements that shock or surprise this   film is full of shockingly violent and shockingly  sexual imagery it's something that the surrealists   associated with the stuff that was repressed by  civilization that was dwelling in the unconscious
(11:43) repressed sexual desires and violent motives we  see this interest in Jack's position over cause   a nation and another famous moment from the film  man and the woman stare at his hand his hand has   ants crawling from the middle of it and then we  get this series of dissolves that are motivated   graphically rather than logically the hand which  has a kind of dark pit in the middle dissolves to   an armpit that image becomes a kind of sea urchin  on the sand which has a similar kind of graphical   shape and that image which has a kind of circle  gives way to a circular Iris composition of a
(12:15) person poking at a disembodied hand on the floor  there is a kind of reasoning that brings these   objects together but that reasoning is primarily  graphical and has nothing to do with narrative   or causation finally let's talk about the way this  film uses a kind of dream logic Louise bunuel said   the plot does not attempt to recount a dream  although it profits by a mechanism analogous   to that of Dreams so in other words the film  is not a rendering of a dream that boonwell   had even though one of the images he said he  got from a dream but the way that it proceeds
(12:46) as a series of events has a kind of logic that is  analogous to that of Dreams what might he mean by   that well one aspect of dream logic that I think  is helpful for understanding how this film works   is a sense of abrupt changes in time plays and  action think about some of the Norms that guide   your dreams most people will testify to a similar  experience when they dream which is that they will   be in one kind of situation or space and then  they will suddenly find themselves in another   situation or space but they won't have a logical  reason to explain how they got from one place to
(13:20) another let me ask you a question you you never  really remember the beginning of a dream do you   always wind up right in the middle of what's  going on I guess yeah so how did we end up here   well we just came from the uh about it Ariana  how did you get here a similar kind of non-causal   change can happen with people or objects an  object can suddenly turn into another object   or a person can suddenly turn into another person  or in some sense be something that they're not so   one question that I think is useful to ask of  this film to get a sense of its dream logic is
(13:54) to ask how did we get here or how did this one  situation emerge for instance in the beginning   of the film The Woman sees the man riding his  bicycle he crashes his bicycle she looks and   sees this she goes downstairs to tend to him  then she finds herself in her apartment once   again but the man is not there instead she's  lying out his clothes on her bed and this is   an action that she's more or less absorbed in and  as an audience we've sort of forgotten about the   man altogether and then suddenly we get a close-up  where she looks screen right and the man is there
(14:25) he seems to emerge out of thin air and she's not  bothered by this it seems completely natural or   consider the moment that I talked about earlier  the woman walks over to the man finds that he's   staring at his hand she notices that there are  ants crawling from his hand we get a series of   cross dissolves that are purely graphically linked  until we happen to upon a strange scene in which   a person on a street is poking at a disembodied  hand on the floor it seems to be a new character   a new human figure and a new situation how did we  get here suddenly we realize through a cut to a
(14:58) window where we have the woman and the man staring  down is that these two spaces are actually linked   so the film willingly depart from its narrative  trajectory without any Rhyme or Reason but it   will equally bring us back or consider this moment  this is in the middle of the film where the man is   aggressively pursuing the woman he looks down he  sees something he bends down he grabs what seems   to be two ropes but then he looks behind him what  else is he dragging we cut to a wide shot it turns
(15:25) out that he's dragging two pianos with two dead  donkeys on them with two priests in tow there's   a sense in which objects will just suddenly  emerge in spaces in a way that violates the laws   of physics but which doesn't violate the laws of  how events proceed in dreams and frankly in a way   that doesn't violate the way in which objects can  appear in film which is compiled through editing   or take another moment in the man's violent  and aggressive pursuit of the woman he gets   his hand caught in the door we get a close-up  shot of the woman she looks screen right we
(15:59) get an eye line match to that very same man  how is it that the man has his hand caught on   the other side of the door and yet is in this  room lying on the bed this is not something   that the film dwells on nor is it something  that the woman is overwhelmingly shocked by   or this the woman wants to get away from the  man she approaches the door she opens the door   she looks forward we get an Island match to what  she's looking at and suddenly she's on a beach   how is it that our apartment is both sitting  on the beach as well as on the second or third
(16:29) story of an apartment building so the film rather  Loosely and confidently gives us these impossible   situations situations that seem natural to a dream  state but are otherwise unnatural to real life and   unnatural to the way that life is often portrayed  in Hollywood conventions and it's important to   note that none of these strange happenings are  the result of dream sequences Orwell and Thompson   will say an impressionist film would motivate  such events that is such wild and impossible   and bizarre events as a character's dreams or  hallucinations but in these films character
(17:03) psychology can't be determined Linda Williams will  say something similar she says in on Shan andalu   and large door the subsequent film that Dolly  and bunuel would make together these films do   not resort to the usual devices of dream sequences  or subjective fantasies devices that ultimately   preserve the Supreme fiction of the unity of  the self even while giving access to its partial   fracturings in other words Williams and bordwell  and Thompson are reminding us that in the 1920s it   was a major advance in the French impressionist  and German expressionist film movements to
(17:37) depict hallucinations dreams and other kinds of  subjective States but those films had a tendency   especially in the French impressionist tradition  to delimit a clear boundary between reality and   dream or reality and hallucination in surrealist  film and in ushan andalu the entire film is a   dream or hallucination it works like a dream it is  not the representation of a dream it works like a   dream and another aspect of the stream logic is  that characters have an unchecked belief in the   reality of their dream world Linda Williams put  this really well she says what happens in Ocean
(18:11) on the Liu is a very peculiar and paradoxical  phenomenon the surrealist goal with respect to the   Cinematic signifier is to approximate as closely  as possible the dreamer's belief in the reality of   the signifier a signifier that the dreamer thinks  is perceived but is really only imagined to put   this in simpler terms when you're dreaming and  you're seeing all kinds of impossible stuff that   could never happen in real life you accept it you  believe it love dreams they feel real while we're
(18:38) in them right it's only when we wake up that we  realize something was actually strange rarely do   you question the reality or the believability of  what you're seeing and what's incredibly strange   about surrealist Cinema is that the characters in  these bizarre situations simply accept the reality   that they're given they move through it they  rarely stop and process the status of what they're   seeing just as we rarely stop and process the  impossibilities that we encounter in dream worlds   so these are some of the ways I think we can  understand surrealist Cinema it's anti-narrative
(19:08) rather than non-narrative and it uses a kind of  dream Logic the last question I want to ask is a   brief one but what does it all mean Louise Manuel  famously said about this film that nothing in the   film symbolizes a new thing and this is something  that a lot of commentaries on the film will often   Echo don't try to make symbolic meaning of any of  this because the filmmakers didn't intend it but   this is not the whole quote but well also said  following this the only method of Investigation
(19:33) of the symbols would be perhaps psychoanalysis so  remember that whatever the core characteristics of   surrealism as a movement is its connection to  Freudian psychoanalysis in an interest in the   unconscious and it's certainly the case that if  you're interested in Freudian psychoanalysis this   film offers a number of seemingly potent symbols  that are going to work for that analysis one film   scholar usefully says this about drawing  meaning from the film in this way he says   a typical psychoanalytic interpretation of Ashan  andalu will usually start by positing a general
(20:04) principle of coherence and function of which the  symbols are organized such as say the portrayal   of adolescent sexual development or a symbolic  portrayal of themes of sexual frustration one   of the cornerstones of Freudian psychoanalysis is  the predominance of sexuality as an explanation   for many human motivations desires and fears so  that same author will briefly go through a number   of events or objects from the film and give us  an offhand interpretation in a Freudian manner   so he'll say the film begins with an invocation  of the castration complex or perhaps the sexual
(20:38) act that is the prologue in which a man slices  a woman's eye might be read in a couple ways it   might be read as a symbol of penetrative sex or it  might be read as a symptom of a fear of castration   if you want to know more about the castration  complex you can check out a link below in another   video I've made on the topic or you might say the  hero stripe box is a feminine symbol that could be   indicative of a mother fixation Freudian analysis  often looks at particular objects and Associates
(21:03) them with male and female sex organs containers  boxes and Hollow spaces often symbolize the female   body having a womb-like quality in this box is  indeed a recurring object throughout the film   a motif The Scholar continues the donkey Laden  pianos with their melons and Priests are symbols   of inhibitions in the superego that with the  castration complex present the cyclist that is   the male hero from Finding Normal expression of  his sexuality so that moment when he's trying to   aggressively pursue the woman but he's hampered  down by these very heavy things those things
(21:34) including pianos and Priests well that might be  a good symbol of the superego the superego is   the part of our subjectivity that follows rules  that is civilized that keeps us from acting out   on our islands and sexual urges so this makes a  kind of sense and he says the lover is buried in   the sand surrounded by insects would finally  show the obsessive omnipotence of desire and   its fundamental lack of satisfaction the film  does indeed end not with the woman and her and   her new man but rather the woman and the original  male hero dead in the sand kind of decaying with
(22:05) insects on them so it's important to note that  this author offers these interpretations not   because he believes in them but because the film  only teases us with these images that seem so   right for Freudian interpretation however he says  the importance of these symbols is not that they   express some latent psychic reality but rather  that they are posited in a self-conscious way   as the elements of a filmic discourse in other  words for this particular scholar he thinks the   point of the film is to ridicule everything  it ridicules and attacks Hollywood narrative
(22:34) conventions and ridicules and attacks Avon guard  conventions and it ridicules and attacks a kind of   simplified version of freudian's psychoanalysis or  maybe even a simplified version of surrealist art   though I don't exactly share this position I end  with it because it affirms some of the Ambitions   of this film how overall the film was trying to  antagonize not meaning in general but certain   conventions of finding meaning and yet ironically  or paradoxically the film is one of the most   written about films in film history and there's  no shortage of interpretations on it so I think
(23:06) I'll end there that's it for our examination  of ashian andalu and I'll see you next time
