>我们通过行动比观察能了解更多——有时候，身体进行一项活动(physically performing an activity) 比观看其他人进行这项活动更好，即使我们的运动共振系统在其他人观察期间强烈触发；
“we know more by doing than by seeing – there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation;” ([Kirsh, 2013, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/RHRZRTWN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7SB4GELH?page=1&annotation=CTAWEYLB))
