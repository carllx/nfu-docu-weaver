### correlations

Strong Positive Correlation:
- `Articles` and `Year` with value: 0.873918876182286
- `MeanTCperYear` and `MeanTCperArt` with value: 0.726600567717085

%% Think about TRUE/FALSE
- When `Articles/N` increases, `MeanTCperYear`(the average number of citations per year) increases.
- When `Articles/N` (the number of publications) increases, `MeanTCperArt`(the average number of citations per article) decreases. This may be due to researchers publishing more articles in the same field, resulting in fewer citations per article.

Highlight:
If the more articles published(`Articles/N`),
- the less citations(`Total.Citations`) received?
- the less citations per article(`Average.Article.Citations`) received?
if so, it may be due to researchers publishing more articles in the same field, but they are `not necessarily high-quality articles`.

### Reference Pyramids

In the Reference Pyramids method, ‚ÄúClassic Literature‚Äù usually refers to the earliest literature that proposes theories or frameworks in a research field, while ‚Äúcore literature‚Äù refers to literature that constructively develops or applies those classic works.

When collecting literature on the topic of ‚ÄúFemale consciousness‚Äù, we first identified the top 4 most frequently co-cited papers as the ‚ÄúClassic Literature.‚Äù We then counted the number of papers citing each classic paper, and ranked them by citation count. We selected papers with over 45 citations as the ‚Äúcore literature‚Äù derived from each classic work. Below, we outline the classic and corresponding core literature in a table format.

The table headers are the Classic Literature. ‚ÄúTI‚Äù indicates the paper title, ‚ÄúPY‚Äù the publication year, and ‚ÄúTC‚Äù the number of citations for each core paper.
