## DESCRIPTION

[Project\_Note\_BibliometrixReportSystem](Bibliometrix%20Report%20System)

%%This is a Bibliometric analysis focused on `human memory statistics`.

This analysis covers the timespan `1978:2023`, drawing from `465` sources including journals, books, and other documents, totaling `1181` documents. During this period, the field experienced an annual growth rate of `8.66`, with the average age of documents being `8.57` years. On average, each document received `50.1` citations, amounting to `5.028` citations per year, contributing to a total of `58433` references.

The document types in this analysis include `924` articles, `163` articles in early access, `27` articles that are proceedings papers, `4` editorial materials, {{proceedings paper}} proceedings papers, `56` reviews, {{review; book chapter}} book chapter reviews, and `6` early access reviews.

In the realm of document contents, there are `3884` instances of Keywords Plus and `3000` Author’s Keywords. The number of authors involved is `8726`, with a total of `11136` author appearances. Among these, `36` authors have produced single-authored documents.

Focusing on author collaboration, there are `36` single-authored documents. On average, there are `0.135` documents per author and `9.43` co-authors per document. The rate of international co-authorships in this field is `32.51`.%%

### correlations

Strong Positive Correlation:
- `Articles` and `Year` with value: 0.810147626942047
- `MeanTCperYear` and `MeanTCperArt` with value: 0.806596394008834

%% Think about TRUE/FALSE
- When `Articles/N` increases, `MeanTCperYear`(the average number of citations per year) increases.
- When `Articles/N` (the number of publications) increases, `MeanTCperArt`(the average number of citations per article) decreases. This may be due to researchers publishing more articles in the same field, resulting in fewer citations per article.

### Reference Pyramids

In the Reference Pyramids method, “Classic Literature” usually refers to the earliest literature that proposes theories or frameworks in a research field, while “core literature” refers to literature that constructively develops or applies those classic works.

When collecting literature on the topic of “human memory statistics”, we first identified the top 5 most frequently co-cited papers as the “Classic Literature.” We then counted the number of papers citing each classic paper, and ranked them by citation count. We selected papers with over 55 citations as the “core literature” derived from each classic work. Below, we outline the classic and corresponding core literature in a table format.

The table headers are the Classic Literature. “TI” indicates the paper title, “PY” the publication year, and “TC” the number of citations for each core paper.
