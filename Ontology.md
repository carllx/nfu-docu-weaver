[[Metaphysics]] 的Central questions(中心问题)之一.



## Being vs Existence
我将尝试向你解释形而上学中的存在和存在的区别是什么。存在和存在是形而上学中的两个重要概念，但它们并不一样。Existence(存在)意味着某些东西是真实的，而不仅仅是想象的。它意味着某物在现实中占有一席之地，并且可以被我们所了解。例如，你存在，因为你是一个真实的人，而不仅仅是一个梦或一个虚构。存在可以与不存在形成对比，后者意味着某物不真实，在现实中没有位置。Being(存在)意味着某物有一种nature(性质)或essence(本质)，使其成为它的一部分。它意味着某物具有某些属性或特征，这些属性或特征界定了它并将它与其他事物区分开来。

例如，你有being(存在感)，因为你是一个人，而不是一只狗或一块石头。存在可以与nothingness(虚无)形成对比，虚无意味着事物根本no nature or essence at all.(没有性质或本质)。

Existence and being are different because something can exist without having being, or have being without existing.(存在和虚无是不同的，因为某物可以存在而不存在，或者有存在而不存在。)

例如，unicorns(独角兽)有存在感，因为它们有使它们成为独角兽的nature or an essence (性质或本质)，但它们不存在，因为它们不是真实的，在现实中没有地位。

另一方面，数字存在，因为它们是真实的，在现实中占有一席之地，但它们没有存在，因为它们没有使它们成为数字的性质或本质。形而上学是对存在和存在的研究，以及它们之间以及与其他事物之间的关系。形而上学者试图回答以下问题：存在的意义是什么？存在的本质是什么？现实的终极原则是什么？我们如何知道什么存在，什么不存在？我们如何知道什么是东西，什么不是东西？这些都是非常困难的问题，但对于理解我们自己和我们周围的世界也是非常重要的问题。

## Being is not a predicate
To understand Aristotle's point, we need to understand his distinction between being and beings. According to Aristotle, being is not a single entity or a single concept, but a way of saying something about things that exist⁷. Being is not a predicate, but a copula, a word that connects a subject and a predicate². For example, in the sentence "Socrates is a man", being is not a property of Socrates, but a way of expressing that Socrates belongs to the category of man. Beings, on the other hand, are the things that can be said to be, the subjects of true propositions⁶. Beings have predicates, that is, properties or attributes that can be predicated of them¹. For example, Socrates has the predicates of being human, wise, mortal, etc. Aristotle's point is that being does not belong to the same category as beings and their predicates, but is a different kind of expression that relates them. Being is not something that can be said of anything, but something that can be said about anything³.

## Being is not a predicate(Kid)
Explain Aristotle's point in a simple way. Aristotle was a very smart man who lived a long time ago in Greece. He liked to think about many things, such as what makes people happy, how to persuade others, and what causes things to change¹²³. He also liked to think about what things are and how we can talk about them. He said that there are two kinds of words: nouns and verbs. Nouns are words that name things, such as "cat", "book", or "Socrates". Verbs are words that show ==actions or states==, such as "run", "read", or "is". Aristotle said that nouns are beings, because they are things that exist. Verbs are being, because they are ways of saying something about things that exist⁵. For example, in the sentence "The cat is black", the noun "cat" is a being, and the verb "is" is being. Aristotle said that beings have predicates, but being does not. Predicates are words that describe or modify nouns, such as "black", "big", or "happy". Predicates are also beings, because they are things that exist. But being is not a predicate, because it does not describe or modify anything. Being is just a word that connects a noun and a predicate, to make a sentence. Being is not a thing that exists, but a way of expressing that something exists⁴. For example, in the sentence "The cat is black", the predicate "black" is a being, and it describes the noun "cat". But the verb "is" is not a being, and it does not describe anything. It just connects the noun "cat" and the predicate "black", to make a sentence. Aristotle's point is that being is different from beings and their predicates, and we should not confuse them. Being is not something that we can say of anything, but something that we can say about anything⁶.

Aristotle 说，有两种词：名词和动词。名词是命名事物的词，如 "猫"、"书 "或 "苏格拉底"。动词是表示行动或状态的词，如 "跑"、"读 "或 "是"。亚里士多德说，名词是存在的，因为它们是存在的事物。动词是存在，因为它们是关于存在的事物的说法方式⁵。例如，在 "猫是黑色的 "这个句子中，名词 "猫 "是一种存在，而动词 "是 "是存在。亚里士多德说，生命有谓语，但存在却没有。谓词是描述或修饰名词的词，如 "黑"、"大"、"快乐"。谓词也是众生，因为它们是存在的事物。但 "存在 "不是一个谓词，因为它不描述或修饰任何东西。存在只是一个连接名词和谓词的词，用来构成一个句子。存在不是一个存在的东西，而是表达某物存在的一种方式⁴。例如，在 "猫是黑色的 "这个句子中，谓语 "黑色 "是一种存在，它描述了名词 "猫"。但动词 "是 "不是一个存在，它也不描述任何东西。它只是把名词 "猫 "和谓词 "黑 "连接起来，组成一个句子。亚里士多德的观点是，"存在 "与 "存在 "及其谓词不同，我们不应该混淆它们。存在不是我们可以对任何事物说的东西，而是我们可以对任何事物说的东西⁶。

## What is the [[Nature|nature]] of [[Ontology|Being]]?

>(-- `(3) Max Hocutt's answer to Ontology (philosophy): What is the nature of Being? - Quora` [quora](https://www.quora.com/Ontology-philosophy-What-is-the-nature-of-Being/answer/Max-Hocutt?ch=10&oid=1477743633589916&share=4887505b&srid=dFlo&target_type=answer))
>[[Ontology]] has no [[Nature|nature]]; only individual kinds of beings have natures. So, nothing can be said about [[Ontology|being]] except that it is all there is, everything. Ditto [[Reality|reality]]. It is not an entity; it is the totality of entities, each sort of which has the kind of [[Ontology|being]] that entities of that kind have. As Aristotle put it, beings have predicates but [[Ontology|being]] does not. As Quine puts it: To be is to be the value of a bound variable. 
>[[Ontology|存在]] 是所有的一切, 只有个别种类的 [[Ontology]]才具有[[Nature]] 
>[[Reality]]也是如此。它不是一个[[实体(Entities)]]；它是实体的总和，其中每一种实体都有该种实体所具有的[[Ontology]]。
>正如[[Aristotle]] 所说，beings  有谓词，但 [[Ontology|being]] 却没有。
>正如 Quine 所说：[[Ontology|存在]]就是成为一个约束变量的值。

几个世纪以来，哲学家们一直在探讨和争论 "Being" 这一概念，它仍然是哲学中最基本和最抽象的问题之一。不同的哲学家对 "存在 "的构成提出了不同的观点，从Aristotle认为只有人类拥有 "Being"，到最近的哲学观点认为 "Being(存在) "是所有存在(existence)的基础。

一些哲学家提出了这样的观点：Being 是所有存在的本质(existence)，它与意识(consciousness)和认识(awareness)交织在一起。他们认为 "存在 "不仅仅是一个抽象的概念，而是可以通过内省(introspection)和正念(mindfulness)来体验的东西。

其他人，比如Max Hocutt，拒绝接受 "存在 "的单一本质(a single essence of Being)的观点，而是将其视为一个更基本的概念，包括所有单独的实体和事物。根据这种观点，"存在 "本身并不是一个实体，而是所有单个实体的总和(the sum total of all individual entities)，其中每个实体都有自己的性质nature。

总之，nature of Being 仍然是一个复杂而多面的概念，几个世纪以来，哲学家们一直在探索和争论。虽然这个问题没有一个明确的答案，但它仍然是哲学中一个重要的调查和探索领域。


How to understand Aristotle's point: "beings have predicates but being does not"?
Aristotle's statement "beings have predicates but being does not" is a central idea in his metaphysics and philosophy of language. According to Aristotle, a predicate is a property or attribute that can be attributed to a subject. For example, in the sentence "Socrates is a man," "man" is a predicate that can be attributed to the subject "Socrates."

Aristotle's point is that individual beings, such as Socrates, have a nature or essence that can be described using predicates. For example, we can say that Socrates is a man, is mortal, is a philosopher, etc. These predicates tell us something about the nature of the being, in this case, Socrates.

However, Being itself cannot be described using predicates. It is not a property that can be attributed to something else. Instead, Being is the most fundamental and universal concept, encompassing all individual beings.

So, Aristotle's statement means that while individual beings have properties or attributes that can be described, Being itself is not a property or attribute and cannot be described in this way. Instead, it is the foundation and basis for all individual beings and their properties.

This idea is part of Aristotle's broader philosophical system, which emphasizes the importance of recognizing the distinction between substance (individual beings) and the properties they possess (their predicates). By understanding this distinction, Aristotle believed that we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of things and the world around us.
